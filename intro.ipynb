He is known for his skill in crafting weapons and armor for the gods and heroes, and his forge is said to be located under Mount Etna, where volcanic activity symbolizes his fiery nature. Vulcan was also associated with volcanic eruptions and was often depicted as a bearded man with a hammer and anvil, representing the elemental forces of fire and creation.</pre></div><div class='basic-renderer-box thought'><h4 class='step-header'>[2] Thought: SetNextNode</h4><pre class='step-text'>kind: set_next_node\n",

Check its recent action and [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/) to see if it is anything to worry about.\\n\\n↑\\nX\\n\\n[How Nvidia Is Injecting AI Into The Health Care Industry](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/nvidia-injecting-ai-health-care-industry)\\n\\n[See All Videos](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos)\\n\\nNOW PLAYING\\nHow Nvidia Is Injecting AI Into The Health Care Industry\\n\\n**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) fell 2% on Friday and was unchanged on Monday after reports from [Barron\\'s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-china-chips-broadcom-243f6f9d?mod=article_inline) that China was trying to boost local AI chip makers and urging local companies to avoid Nvidia chipes. China accounted for 11% of Nvidia sales in the first half the fiscal year ending in January.\\n\\nNvidia stock cleared multiple [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/?refcode=BBB-04262022-2-B-9:04:2022:2Q:NewsLetter:Email:BBB-04262022:na:na:na:na:26:10:2:B:9&j=1566189&sfmc_sub=172274927&l=222_HTML&u=20328680&mid=100016628&jb=1) entries last week. The stock is 5% above its [50\\\\-day moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) Shares are 14% below their split\\\\-adjusted all\\\\-time high of 140\\\\.76 after rising more than 4\\\\.6% last week. But should you be [buying Nvidia stock now](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/)?\\n\\n[Timing your stock purchases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/) can surely improve gains. Yet even with an obvious market leader like Nvidia, it\\'s not easy to tell whether you should [buy or sell the stock now](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/). [Chart signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/) and checking [technical measures](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) can help investors assess [whether Nvidia stock is a buy now](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/).\\n\\nOn Tuesday, AI server provider **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) started trading on a split\\\\-adjusted basis. The company announced the 10\\\\-for\\\\-1 stock split in its fourth\\\\-quarter earnings report in August. Stock splits increase the number of shares outstanding but do not change the market capitalization of the stock.\\n\\nAI\\'s Total Addressable Market\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nOn Wednesday, shares rose after consulting firm Bain said the total addressable market for artificial intelligence hardware and software will grow 40% to 55% for [at least next three years](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-ai-chip-demand-95760797?mod=search_headline). Demand for Nvidia\\'s next generation graphic processing units GB200 is expected to reach 3 million in 2026 vs. 1\\\\.5 million for its H100 units in 2023\\\\.\\n\\nAccording to [Barron\\'s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-top-performers-d0484c61?siteid=yhoof2), Nvidia last week lost its place as the best performing S\\\\&P 500 stock so far this year. **Vistra** ([VST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VST)) had gained 190% year to date as of Monday\\'s closing price last week, whereas Nvidia was up 135%.\\n\\nBut Nvidia stock rose last Monday after news that China e\\\\-commerce behemoth **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) will collaborate with Nvidia to improve autonomous driving technology for Chinese EV manufacturers, several of which are rivals to **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). Alibaba\\'s portfolio of large\\\\-language models are now integrated with Nvidia\\'s drive platform for autonomous vehicles.\\n\\nOn [Monday last week](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-top-performers-d0484c61), analysts at Melius Research gave the stock a price target of 165 with a buy rating as the company ramps up its Blackwell chip production in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nWhite House Meeting\\n-------------------\\n\\nIn September, shares climbed above the 50\\\\-day moving average amid news that Nvidia and OpenAI chief executive officers, Jensen Huang and Sam Altman, met officials at the White House to discuss AI infrastructure spending. According to [reports](https://www.yahoo.com/news/openai-nvidia-executives-discuss-ai-232621359.html?fr=yhssrp_catchall), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) executives were also present. The White House announced an interagency task force to accelerate permissions for setting up data centers.\\n\\nHowever, news that companies may be diversifying and looking for other chips besides Nvidia\\'s likely weighed on Nvidia stock. According to [Barron\\'s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-buy-sell-d10180d0?siteid=yhoof2), Saudi oil behemoth Aramco is planning on using chips made by a startup Groq to offer \"AI computing power to local companies.\"\\n\\nThe news followed [Huang remarks](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-addresses-the-big-question-on-investors-minds-3699b564?&mod=article_inline) that the return on investment for artificial intelligence infrastructure plays like Nvidia remained strong since \"infrastructure players like ourselves and all the cloud service providers put the infrastructure in the cloud, so that developers could use these machines to train the models, fine\\\\-tune the models, guardrail the models, and so forth.\"\\n\\nAnalysts at Bernstein said that after its phenomenal growth, sustainability is the main question Nvidia faces, but the \"[time to worry is clearly not now](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-set-to-extend-gains-the-time-to-worry-is-clearly-not-now-9425d38d).\"\\n\\nOn Sept. 3, Nvidia fell sharply below the [50\\\\-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and saw its largest one\\\\-day market cap loss for any U.S. company, according to Dow Jones Markets Data.\\n\\nEarnings From AI Giants\\n-----------------------\\n\\nResults from other AI leading companies have influenced the stock. Last week, memory chip maker **Micron** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) cited robust AI demand, which gave Nvidia stock a lift.\\n\\n**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) results showed strong demand for AI chips. According to the Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, Oracle is building a data center with \"[acres of Nvidia GPU clusters for training large language scale AI models](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-stock-orcl-q1-report-cloudworld-ai-cloud/).\"\\n\\nEarlier, results from**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) weighed on Nvidia stock. Broadcom\\'s [sales and earnings beat estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/avgo-stock-broadcom-earnings-fiscal-q3-2024/) but its sales outlook disappointed. Broadcom\\'s outlook has implications for demand for AI chips.\\n\\n\\xa0Shares also came under pressure amid news that the Department of Justice was investigating antitrust regulations concerning the artificial intelligence chip company.\\xa0According to reports, [the DOJ originally sent questionnaires to the company](https://www.reuters.com/legal/nvidia-hit-with-subpoena-us-justice-department-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-09-03/). But it has now sent subpoenas.\\n\\nShares fell 6\\\\.4% after earnings on Aug. 28 even though Nvidia beat analyst estimates.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s Second\\\\-Quarter Results\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIn August, Nvidia reported earnings that beat Wall Street views. Sales of $30\\\\.04 billion were higher than $28\\\\.7 billion analysts expected and came in 122% ahead of the year\\\\-earlier quarter. Earnings also came in above views of 65 cents at 68 cents per share and were 152% higher than the prior year. The artificial intelligence chip leader also guided higher for the current quarter with [sales of $32\\\\.5 billion vs. views of $31\\\\.7 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-fiscal-q2-2025-earnings-nvda-stock/).\\n\\nEarnings have moved Nvidia stock in 2023 and 2024 and that is shining proof of why [fundamental performance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/) is one of the pillars of the', 1, 2)</details></pre></div><div class='basic-renderer-box observation'><h4 class='step-header'>[7] Observation: ToolResult</h4><pre class='step-text'>tool_call_id: call_OcYFowuXV2Av7kZ7y4Vawjwd\n",

Because that holding pattern is looking a lot like a \"pennant,\" which many Wall Street chart watchers see as a sign suggesting the previous uptrend will eventually reassert itself.\\n\\n Nvidia\\'s stock (NVDA) fell 3% in afternoon trading, to pull back from a three\\\\-month\\\\-long descending trendline. It was essentially trading where it was in early June.\\n\\n The semiconductor maker and AI play\\'s stock has lost 11\\\\.2% since it closed at a record $135\\\\.58 on June 18, at which time it had posted a year\\\\-to\\\\-date gain of 173\\\\.8%. But the stock has also rallied 21\\\\.7% since it closed at a 21/2 \\\\-month low of $98\\\\.91 on Aug. 7, and has been following an ascending trendline for the past several months.\\n\\n The chart below, is what a pennant continuation pattern looks like:\\n\\n Like BTIG technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky said, while the stock\\'s gains this week was \"rejected\" at the downtrend line, the recent trading pattern looks like \"the pause that refreshes.\"\\n\\n So while there could still be some volatility in the stock, while the trending resistance and support lines continue to converge, pennants tend to be resolved in the direction of the previous trend, which was up.\\n\\n The support line currently extends to about $104\\\\.75, while the resistance line would extend to about $125\\\\.80 on Monday.\\n\\n Don\\'t miss: Nvidia investors don\\'t need to worry \\\\- unless the stock falls below these prices.\\n\\n Also read: Nvidia investors just got a $1 trillion reason to be even more bullish.\\n\\n What happens after the uptrend resumes is up for some debate, as there are different ways to calculate a \"measured move\" continuation.\\n\\n Some will take the widest part of the pennant, then add it to the breakout point to get an upside target. For Nvidia, that would mean the $46\\\\.83 rally from the May 9 closing low to the record high would be added to the point where the stock crosses above the top of the pennant.\\n\\n If the breakout occurs on Monday, then the measured move target would be around $172\\\\.63, or about 43% above current levels.\\n\\n Others see the pennant as sitting in the middle of a rally, so they will take the length of the \"flagpole,\" or the entire rally, and add that to the breakout point.\\n\\n For Nvidia, the current flagpole is about $88 tall. So a breakout on Monday would target about $213\\\\.80, or 77% above current levels.\\n\\n Of course, a break of the support line could lead to a full retracement, which is about 60% below current levels.\\n\\n A check of history shows that the late 2018 downtrend that followed a three\\\\-year rally took the stock down 56%, and the late\\\\-2021 to late\\\\-2022 downtrend that also followed a three\\\\-year rally saw the stock lose 66%.\\n\\n The current rally has only lasted two years.\\n\\n \\\\-Tomi Kilgore\\n\\n This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones \\\\& Co.

market?\\n============================================================\\n\\nNvidia's market value surpassed $3 trillion in 2024, fueled by the generative AI boom, rebounding tech sector and 154% stock growth in 2024\\\\. However, there are questions if AI will sustain the hype cycle.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n* Share this item with your network:\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n\\n*\\n*\\n* +\\n\\t+\\n\\t+\\n\\t+\\n\\n![Amanda Hetler](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/hetler_amanda.jpg)\\nBy\\n* [Amanda Hetler,](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Amanda-Hetler)\\nSenior Editor\\n\\nPublished: 04 Sep 2024\\n\\nNvidia continues to grow as it surpassed the $3 trillion mark on June 18, 2024, before dipping just below $3 trillion at the end of August 2024\\\\. Nvidia is now the third largest\\\\-listed U.S. company based on market capitalization value behind Apple and Microsoft. In the middle of 2023, Nvidia passed the $1 trillion mark and was more valuable than Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company. In just nine months, the company's market worth increased from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in February 2024, and it took only three months to reach $3 trillion in June 2024\\\\. However, even with impressive growth, [Nvidia stock](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda) was down as much as 5% after its 2024 second\\\\-quarter earnings report.\\n\\nThe rise of [Nvidia](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/NVIDIA) took some time. The tech sector faced a rough 2022\\\\. It started to rebound in 2023 despite [tech layoffs](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Tech-sector-layoffs-explained-What-you-need-to-know). [Generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI) is one of the main drivers of its rebound, and the stock market is showing signs of this rebound. The Nasdaq index is heavy in tech stocks and finished 2023 up [43%](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2023-in-review:-key-stock-trends-and-sector-shifts-unveiled). The rise of generative AI led to a tech bull market, which is a time of expansion in the stock exchange.\\n\\nThe top\\\\-tier group of tech stocks is known as the Magnificent Seven and includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The Magnificent Seven company stocks were up an average of 111% in 2023, and Nvidia was up 239% in 2023\\\\.\\n\\nOn June 7, 2024, Nvidia stock completed a 10\\\\-for\\\\-1 stock split, which will make its stock price approximately $120 from $1,200\\\\. The shares will begin trading at the split\\\\-adjusted rates on June 10, 2024\\\\. Nvidia is splitting its stock to make it more accessible to employees and investors. This split will not change the overall value of the company. This means any stockholder who owned a share of stock before the split will receive nine more shares after the split. Over time, this lower stock price makes it easier for investors to access shares.\\n\\nEven with the daily ups and downs of the stock market, investors are taking notice of this growth and wondering how much the AI demand may drive the tech market in 2024\\\\.\\n\\nThe rise of Nvidia\\n------------------\\n\\nNvidia is one of the world's largest producers of [GPUs](https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/definition/GPU-graphics-processing-unit). GPUs are computer chips or semiconductors that use math operations to produce visuals and images. The GPU manages and speeds up graphic workloads and displays visual content on a device such as PC or smartphone.\\n\\nEach of Nvidia's earnings reports exceeded expectations throughout 2023 as AI started gaining momentum and attention. Nvidia's advanced chips can use and process the massive amounts needed to train generative AI programs, such as [ChatGPT](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/ChatGPT) and Gemini. Since Nvidia dominated this market before the increasing need for AI, Nvidia only grew larger as demand soared.\\n\\n[Nvidia reported](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2025) revenue of $30 billion for its fiscal second quarter ending July 28, 2024\\\\. This revenue was up 15% from the previous quarter and up 152% from one year prior. The company earned record quarterly data center revenue of $26\\\\.3 billion, which increased 16% from the previous quarter and was up 154% from the previous year.\\n\\nTo put it in perspective, companies \\\\-\\\\- such as Apple and Microsoft \\\\-\\\\- are spending money on AI, and Nvidia is making money on AI as it produces the chips to run the technology.\\n\\nBusinesses need hardware to support high amounts of energy with the AI wave, but these advanced chips are also needed for the [metaverse](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/The-metaverse-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know), gaming and [spatial computing](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/spatial-computing). Nvidia also makes chips for cars as technology continues to advance.\\n\\nThe core reasons for the rise of Nvidia stock\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe rise of generative AI is one of the key factors of Nvidia's rise. However, there are some other reasons Nvidia stock increased significantly.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. The rise of supercomputers\\n\\nNvidia's chips power supercomputers because of the large amounts of data needed for this advanced technology. Supercomputing technology is used by companies, such as Meta for its AI Research SuperCluster computer, to train complex AI models. Tesla is also starting to build an AI\\\\-focused supercomputer for its vehicles.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Demand for generative AI\\n\\nWith no signs of the demand for generative AI slowing down, Nvidia is poised to grow as each new system is adopted. The AI industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% in the next 10 years, according to [Bloomberg Intelligence](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/generative-ai-to-become-a-1-3-trillion-market-by-2032-research-finds/). The demand for generative AI products could make the generative [AI market](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/AI-hardware-vendors-band-together-to-challenge-Nvidia) worth $1\\\\.3 trillion by 2032\\\\.\\n\\nNvidia's A100 GPU chips are used in training the model for [ChatGPT](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/ChatGPT). Companies, such as OpenAI, that use large amounts of data for tasks such as training [large language models](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/large-language-model-LLM) evolve quickly and need more accelerated computing. The demand for GPUs will only grow as these systems train and evolve with more data.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. The changing world of the metaverse and XR\\n\\nNvidia has played a role in the metaverse and the [virtual and augmented reality landscape](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/feature/AR-vs-VR-vs-MR-Differences-similarities-and-manufacturing-uses) with its Omniverse platform. Nvidia offers 3D modeling programs to help stream extended reality (XR) content efficiently. As the metaverse evolves, so does the demand for Nvidia chips to run the metaverse. Companies are turning to [XR programs](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/XRs-wide-range-of-interface-technologies-achieving-total-immersiveness) to create virtual environments for training.\\n\\nThe gaming world is also a large customer of Nvidia's graphics division. Video games need stronger cards to run the high\\\\-resolution images, especially as more games move to the cloud and away from the console. Nvidia's gaming GPUs, such as [GeForce RTX 4070](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/gfecnt/20234/geforce-rtx-4070/), help power video games at a higher resolution and quicker speed.\\n\\n### 4\\\\. Strategic placement\\n\\nNvidia is a large part of the cryptocurrency world. Miners use its cards for [mining tokens](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Blockchain-terminology-A-glossary-for-beginners), which requires a great deal of power. There was an unprecedented demand for Nvidia's cards as cryptocurrency took off.\\n\\nFuture of Nvidia\\n----------------\\n\\nWhile Nvidia's processors run most of the data centers that power generative AI, there are still some possible challenges ahead, including competition from tech giants to make their own AI chips, economic uncertainty and a rise in competition.\\n\\nThe generative AI market is expected to continue growing, but more rules and regulations are going to be introduced that could affect Nvidia's AI chips. The U.S. trade restrictions on China's advanced semiconductors are also impacting Nvidia's growth, as Chinese sales were a large part of Nvidia's data center sales.\\n\\nWith Nvidia's noticeable growth, other competitors are offering similar chips, such as AMD's Instinct MI200 family of GPU accelerators. Intel also launched a set of fifth\\\\-generation Intel Xeon processors for data centers. Companies may not want to rely on one company and will start exploring these other vendors, which could hurt Nvidia's growth.\\n\\nIt's hard to predict whether Nvidia will continue its growth at its current pace. Nvidia has built a solid foundation in the AI market, and if the generative AI market grows as predicted, its revenue will continue to grow. But it's unknown how much of the market Nvidia's competitors will take. Nvidia still has a strong share in the face of rising competition as it recently announced its H200 computing platform. Cloud providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft have developed AI processors, but they work with Nvidia chips.\\n\\nThe market is evolving quickly. Enterprises are looking to adopt generative AI, leading to the creation of new vendors to meet business needs. New areas such as security and compliance will also change the generative AI market in the business world.\\n\\nNvidia’s data center business is a leading driver of success and has a demand for AI infrastructure. Data center sales made up nearly 87% of Nvidia’s revenue. Other Big Tech companies \\\\-\\\\- such as Google, Microsoft and Meta \\\\-\\\\- continue to invest in AI and announced increased AI spending in their earnings reports.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA’s stock outlook for 2024, 2025, and the next decade. Join us as we explore detailed insights into the company’s financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential in new markets like autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nNVIDIA’s Recent Price History\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation, founded in 1993, went public in 1999 with an initial share price of $12\\\\. Note that, adjusted for the multiple splits NVDA has undergone, this is equivalent to $0\\\\.4375—we’ll refer to the split\\\\-adjusted price from here.\\n\\nThe company quickly made a name for itself in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, and its stock saw steady growth through the early 2000s.\\n\\nIndicative pricing only\\n\\n### Early 2000s to 2015: Building the Foundation\\n\\nThroughout the 2000s, NVIDIA expanded its product line, targeting both gaming and professional markets. Significant milestones included the release of the GeForce 256 in 1999, often considered the world's first GPU.\\n\\nThe company's stock price rallied in the dot\\\\-com bubble, cresting $6 in 2001\\\\. After sinking to a low of $0\\\\.60 in 2002, NVDA began a long uptrend, peaking at $9\\\\.92 in 2007, just before the 2008 financial crisis sent it plummeting back to $1\\\\.44\\\\. Continuing to expand its presence in the GPU arena over the years, NVIDIA’s stock rebounded, closing 2015 at $8\\\\.24\\\\.\\n\\n### 2016\\\\-2017: The Boom Begins\\n\\nThe period from 2016 onwards marked a dramatic shift for NVIDIA. Driven by the increasing demand for GPUs in gaming, data centres, and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA's stock price began to soar.\\n\\nBy mid\\\\-2016, NVIDIA had introduced the Pascal architecture, which significantly improved performance and efficiency. This innovation, coupled with strong financial results, saw the stock price surge to a high of $29\\\\.98 by the end of 2016, while by the end of 2017, the stock had been trading near $50\\\\.\\n\\n### 2018\\\\-2020: Volatility and Growth\\n\\nIn 2018, NVIDIA’s stock experienced volatility due to a slowdown in cryptocurrency mining, which had previously driven GPU sales. The stock price peaked at around $73\\\\.19 in October 2018 but closed the year at $33\\\\.38\\\\. Despite this, NVIDIA's long\\\\-term prospects remained strong, bolstered by continued advancements in AI and data centre applications. By early 2020, the stock price had rebounded to above $70\\\\.\\n\\n### 2020\\\\-Present: Surging Ahead\\n\\nWhile the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic caused a brief blip in NVDA’s price, the event actually further accelerated demand for NVIDIA’s products as more people turned to gaming and remote work. NVIDIA's willingness to acquire Arm Holdings in September 2020 for $40 billion highlighted its strategic expansion.\\n\\nThe stock price broke the $125 mark in mid\\\\-2020, closing 2021 at $294\\\\.11\\\\. While rising interest rates and restrictive financial conditions drove NVDA lower in 2022, to a low of $108\\\\.13, the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the resulting surge in AI adoption marked a watershed moment for NVIDIA.\\n\\nNVIDIA quickly became one of the world’s most valuable companies in 2023 thanks to exploding demand for its products. In May 2023, it crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold and peaked at $502\\\\.66 in August.\\n\\nNVIDIA continues to dominate the GPU and AI computing space in 2024, recently reaching an all\\\\-time high of $974 in March 2024\\\\. Notably, it almost reached a $2 trillion market cap faster than both Microsoft and Apple. NVDA is currently worth around $950 at the time of writing in late May.\\n\\nWant to keep up to date with the latest NVDA price movements?

Companies are increasingly adopting NVIDIA's AI solutions to enhance productivity and operational efficiency, further driving demand for NVIDIA's products.\\n\\nOverall, NVIDIA's robust position in the AI market, combined with its strategic initiatives and strong financial performance, is seen as likely to push NVDA to its price targets in 2024\\\\.\\n\\n### NVIDIA Stock Prediction for 2024\\n\\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jqXH60zwKr288NOIKHMgGcAMEfIPbDeQPIbrMDyOW2HSo2yz_gj1z-1jXPu3ib-E3GFazesg8eZlrcSOYlLPe705trsPxkinIpBFvodeEqT5L9UGBxG88VZPJF-uyHgMJpbPX8GKNy8N_ISxDhCs2Xs)Mid\\\\-Year 2024:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 1179\\\\.74 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 993\\\\.57 (WalletInvestor)\\n\\nEnd\\\\-of\\\\-Year 2024:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 2493\\\\.52 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 1235\\\\.89 (WalletInvestor)\\n\\nAnalytical NVDA Stock Forecast for 2025\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nAnalysts have high expectations for NVIDIA stock price targets in 2025, driven by strong financial performance and strategic growth initiatives. Analysts forecast NVIDIA's full\\\\-year revenue to reach approximately $111\\\\.3 billion in 2025, a significant increase from the $26\\\\.97 billion reported in 2023\\\\. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to rise correspondingly, reflecting the company's continued profitability and operational efficiency.\\n\\n### AI and Data Center Dominance\\n\\nNVIDIA's leadership in AI and data centre technologies is a key driver of its stock performance.

This strategic approach is anticipated to support long\\\\-term growth and sustain its competitive edge\\u200b.\\n\\n### Market Sentiment and Analyst Upgrades\\n\\nMarket sentiment towards NVIDIA remains positive, with numerous analyst upgrades reflecting confidence in the company's growth prospects. Despite some concerns about overvaluation, the consensus is that NVIDIA's strong fundamentals and leading position in key technological areas justify its high stock price. The stock's performance in 2025 is expected to take advantage of continued innovation and execution of its strategic initiatives\\u200b.\\n\\n### NVIDIA Stock Prediction 2025\\n\\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/y9wdbJ9FGfC4XjJyUWY1E1mEMngiPBNUhO2Mz15o1Q3dvLCkLJiqbUlIDOzXREUUTJtbobqM1dLwIXLcxWLUBFuWuJfIgIh2I6YvpgrEpflBqdjILnmrr19sTZjXYknV5L5hRELZqEUrOHl9-XI1big)Mid\\\\-Year 2025:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 3827\\\\.17 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 1364\\\\.44 (Traders Union)\\n\\nEnd\\\\-of\\\\-Year 2025:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 5219\\\\.46 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 1484\\\\.36 (Traders Union)\\n\\nAnalytical NVIDIA Stock Price Forecast for 2026 to 2030 and Beyond\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA is expected to maintain its technological leadership and expand its market presence from 2026 to 2030\\\\.

       "<details><summary>2189 characters ...</summary>In late 2022, several factors influenced Nvidia's stock price:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Rising Interest Rates and Financial Conditions**: The broader economic environment, including rising interest rates and restrictive financial conditions, negatively impacted Nvidia's stock price. This was a common trend affecting many tech stocks during that period.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **AI and Data Center Demand**: Despite the broader economic challenges, Nvidia continued to benefit from strong demand for AI and data center technologies. The debut of ChatGPT and the resulting surge in AI adoption marked a significant moment for Nvidia, driving demand for its products.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **China's Market Dynamics**: Nvidia faced challenges in the Chinese market, which accounted for a significant portion of its sales. Reports indicated that China was boosting local AI chip makers and urging local companies to avoid Nvidia chips, which impacted Nvidia's stock.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Stock Splits and Market Reactions**: Nvidia's stock was influenced by market reactions to stock splits and other corporate actions. For instance, the 10-for-1 stock split by AI server provider Super Micro Computer (SMCI) had an impact on Nvidia's stock.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Earnings Reports and Analyst Ratings**: Nvidia's earnings reports and analyst ratings played a crucial role. Despite beating analyst estimates in some quarters, the stock experienced volatility due to mixed reactions to its financial performance and future guidance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Technological Advancements and Strategic Initiatives**: Nvidia's advancements in AI, data centers, and emerging technologies like autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT) continued to drive investor interest. Strategic investments and partnerships also contributed to the stock's performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Regulatory and Competitive Landscape**: Nvidia faced regulatory scrutiny and competition from other tech giants and startups. The Department of Justice's investigation into antitrust regulations concerning Nvidia's AI chip business added to the uncertainty.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, Nvidia's stock price in late 2022 was influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors, market dynamics, technological advancements, and regulatory challenges.</details></pre></div>"
