    "**TapeAgents** is a framework that leverages a structured, replayable log (**Tape**) of the agent session to facilitate all stages of the LLM Agent development lifecycle. In TapeAgents, the agent reasons by processing the tape and the LLM output to produce new thoughts, actions, control flow steps and append them to the tape. The environment then reacts to the agent’s actions by likewise appending observation steps to the tape.\n",

Once we have the stock ticker symbol, use the `get_stock_data` function to retrieve the historical stock prices for Vulcan Materials. We can set the `start_date` parameter to a reasonable date, such as 5 years ago, and the `end_date` parameter to the current date.\\n\\n3. Analyze the returned list of tuples from `get_stock_data` to understand the overall trend and fluctuations in Vulcan Materials' stock price over the past 5 years.\\n\\n4.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA’s stock outlook for 2024, 2025, and the next decade. Join us as we explore detailed insights into the company’s financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential in new markets like autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nNVIDIA’s Recent Price History\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation, founded in 1993, went public in 1999 with an initial share price of $12\\\\. Note that, adjusted for the multiple splits NVDA has undergone, this is equivalent to $0\\\\.4375—we’ll refer to the split\\\\-adjusted price from here.\\n\\nThe company quickly made a name for itself in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, and its stock saw steady growth through the early 2000s.\\n\\nIndicative pricing only\\n\\n### Early 2000s to 2015: Building the Foundation\\n\\nThroughout the 2000s, NVIDIA expanded its product line, targeting both gaming and professional markets. Significant milestones included the release of the GeForce 256 in 1999, often considered the world's first GPU.\\n\\nThe company's stock price rallied in the dot\\\\-com bubble, cresting $6 in 2001\\\\. After sinking to a low of $0\\\\.60 in 2002, NVDA began a long uptrend, peaking at $9\\\\.92 in 2007, just before the 2008 financial crisis sent it plummeting back to $1\\\\.44\\\\. Continuing to expand its presence in the GPU arena over the years, NVIDIA’s stock rebounded, closing 2015 at $8\\\\.24\\\\.\\n\\n### 2016\\\\-2017: The Boom Begins\\n\\nThe period from 2016 onwards marked a dramatic shift for NVIDIA. Driven by the increasing demand for GPUs in gaming, data centres, and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA's stock price began to soar.\\n\\nBy mid\\\\-2016, NVIDIA had introduced the Pascal architecture, which significantly improved performance and efficiency. This innovation, coupled with strong financial results, saw the stock price surge to a high of $29\\\\.98 by the end of 2016, while by the end of 2017, the stock had been trading near $50\\\\.\\n\\n### 2018\\\\-2020: Volatility and Growth\\n\\nIn 2018, NVIDIA’s stock experienced volatility due to a slowdown in cryptocurrency mining, which had previously driven GPU sales.

Despite this, NVIDIA's long\\\\-term prospects remained strong, bolstered by continued advancements in AI and data centre applications. By early 2020, the stock price had rebounded to above $70\\\\.\\n\\n### 2020\\\\-Present: Surging Ahead\\n\\nWhile the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic caused a brief blip in NVDA’s price, the event actually further accelerated demand for NVIDIA’s products as more people turned to gaming and remote work. NVIDIA's willingness to acquire Arm Holdings in September 2020 for $40 billion highlighted its strategic expansion.\\n\\nThe stock price broke the $125 mark in mid\\\\-2020, closing 2021 at $294\\\\.11\\\\. While rising interest rates and restrictive financial conditions drove NVDA lower in 2022, to a low of $108\\\\.13, the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the resulting surge in AI adoption marked a watershed moment for NVIDIA.\\n\\nNVIDIA quickly became one of the world’s most valuable companies in 2023 thanks to exploding demand for its products. In May 2023, it crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold and peaked at $502\\\\.66 in August.\\n\\nNVIDIA continues to dominate the GPU and AI computing space in 2024, recently reaching an all\\\\-time high of $974 in March 2024\\\\. Notably, it almost reached a $2 trillion market cap faster than both Microsoft and Apple. NVDA is currently worth around $950 at the time of writing in late May.\\n\\nWant to keep up to date with the latest NVDA price movements?

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA’s stock outlook for 2024, 2025, and the next decade. Join us as we explore detailed insights into the company’s financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential in new markets like autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nNVIDIA’s Recent Price History\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation, founded in 1993, went public in 1999 with an initial share price of $12\\\\. Note that, adjusted for the multiple splits NVDA has undergone, this is equivalent to $0\\\\.4375—we’ll refer to the split\\\\-adjusted price from here.\\n\\nThe company quickly made a name for itself in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, and its stock saw steady growth through the early 2000s.\\n\\nIndicative pricing only\\n\\n### Early 2000s to 2015: Building the Foundation\\n\\nThroughout the 2000s, NVIDIA expanded its product line, targeting both gaming and professional markets. Significant milestones included the release of the GeForce 256 in 1999, often considered the world's first GPU.\\n\\nThe company's stock price rallied in the dot\\\\-com bubble, cresting $6 in 2001\\\\. After sinking to a low of $0\\\\.60 in 2002, NVDA began a long uptrend, peaking at $9\\\\.92 in 2007, just before the 2008 financial crisis sent it plummeting back to $1\\\\.44\\\\. Continuing to expand its presence in the GPU arena over the years, NVIDIA’s stock rebounded, closing 2015 at $8\\\\.24\\\\.\\n\\n### 2016\\\\-2017: The Boom Begins\\n\\nThe period from 2016 onwards marked a dramatic shift for NVIDIA. Driven by the increasing demand for GPUs in gaming, data centres, and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA's stock price began to soar.\\n\\nBy mid\\\\-2016, NVIDIA had introduced the Pascal architecture, which significantly improved performance and efficiency. This innovation, coupled with strong financial results, saw the stock price surge to a high of $29\\\\.98 by the end of 2016, while by the end of 2017, the stock had been trading near $50\\\\.\\n\\n### 2018\\\\-2020: Volatility and Growth\\n\\nIn 2018, NVIDIA’s stock experienced volatility due to a slowdown in cryptocurrency mining, which had previously driven GPU sales. The stock price peaked at around $73\\\\.19 in October 2018 but closed the year at $33\\\\.38\\\\. Despite this, NVIDIA's long\\\\-term prospects remained strong, bolstered by continued advancements in AI and data centre applications. By early 2020, the stock price had rebounded to above $70\\\\.\\n\\n### 2020\\\\-Present: Surging Ahead\\n\\nWhile the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic caused a brief blip in NVDA’s price, the event actually further accelerated demand for NVIDIA’s products as more people turned to gaming and remote work. NVIDIA's willingness to acquire Arm Holdings in September 2020 for $40 billion highlighted its strategic expansion.\\n\\nThe stock price broke the $125 mark in mid\\\\-2020, closing 2021 at $294\\\\.11\\\\. While rising interest rates and restrictive financial conditions drove NVDA lower in 2022, to a low of $108\\\\.13, the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the resulting surge in AI adoption marked a watershed moment for NVIDIA.\\n\\nNVIDIA quickly became one of the world’s most valuable companies in 2023 thanks to exploding demand for its products. In May 2023, it crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold and peaked at $502\\\\.66 in August.\\n\\nNVIDIA continues to dominate the GPU and AI computing space in 2024, recently reaching an all\\\\-time high of $974 in March 2024\\\\. Notably, it almost reached a $2 trillion market cap faster than both Microsoft and Apple. NVDA is currently worth around $950 at the time of writing in late May.\\n\\nWant to keep up to date with the latest NVDA price movements?

Analysts expect the company to leverage its strong portfolio in AI chips and data centre solutions, potentially driving substantial revenue growth.\\n\\nThe company's financial performance in 2023 set a strong foundation, with NVIDIA reporting record total revenue for the full fiscal year of 2024 of $60\\\\.9 billion, a 126% increase from the previous year. This growth was largely fueled by the data centre segment, which saw a 409% YoY increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, underscoring the rising demand for AI\\\\-driven technologies\\u200b.\\n\\nIn 2024, NVIDIA aims to continue its trajectory by focusing on expanding its AI ecosystem. Key initiatives include the development of new AI chips and the expansion of its software and services portfolio. The company plans to enhance its offerings in generative AI, which has become a critical area for growth and innovation\\u200b. This includes leveraging its partnerships and customer base to drive further adoption of its AI solutions.\\n\\nFurthermore, NVIDIA's strategic investments in autonomous driving and the automotive sector are expected to bear fruit. The company has made significant strides with its NVIDIA DRIVE platform, collaborating with major automotive manufacturers like Great Wall Motors, ZEEKR, and Xiaomi to integrate its AI\\\\-powered driving systems.\\n\\nAnalysts are particularly optimistic about NVIDIA's ability to generate substantial free cash flow. Projections suggest that NVIDIA could achieve $100 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, providing ample resources for strategic acquisitions and further R\\\\&D investments\\u200b.\\n\\nAnalytical NVIDIA Price Prediction for 2024\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA's target prices in 2024 remain elevated, driven by several key factors. Analysts project strong growth due to the relentless demand for AI technologies, which NVIDIA is well\\\\-positioned to capitalise on.\\n\\nThe company's financial performance in 2023 laid a solid foundation, with significant gains in revenue and net income, particularly in the data centre segment. NVIDIA's Q3 2023 results showed a three\\\\-fold increase in data centre revenue year\\\\-over\\\\-year, reaching $14\\\\.51 billion\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nAnalysts emphasise that NVIDIA's stock is not just about hardware sales but the entire AI ecosystem it has built. This comprehensive approach is expected to drive substantial recurring revenue, bolstering the company's financial stability and growth prospects.\\n\\nDespite a 230%\\\\+ gain in 2023, NVIDIA's fundamentals have improved, supporting the stock's valuation.

About Vulcan\\n\\nOur business is built on essentials. What we mine and sell—aggregates—are indispensable to infrastructure and growth. How we run our company also comes down to essentials. We run our business with great discipline and integrity. We maintain a great place to work and grow. We take care of the land through the entire cycle of productive use from mining to restoration and re\\\\-use. We serve our customers and communities well. Always with the long view in mind. This is how we sustain success.\\n\\nWe are Vulcan. And we deliver value.\\n\\n![About Vulcan](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/about-vulcan/aboutlanding_body.png?sfvrsn=c96e2a2f_1)\\n\\nVulcan Materials Company is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates—primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel—and a major producer of aggregates\\\\-based construction materials including asphalt and ready\\\\-mixed concrete. Our coast\\\\-to\\\\-coast footprint and strategic distribution network align with and serve the nation’s growth centers. We are headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama.\\n\\nVulcan has over\\xa0404\\\\*\\xa0active aggregates facilities, and\\xa071\\\\*\\xa0asphalt facilities and\\xa0142\\\\*\\xa0concrete facilities, which also consume aggregates.\\xa0Most\\xa0are located in the U.S. except for our quarries and marine terminals on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada,\\xa0Honduras\\xa0and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.\\n\\nWhat we produce is used in nearly all forms of construction. In particular, large quantities of aggregates are used to build and repair valuable infrastructure such as roads, bridges, waterworks and ports, and to construct buildings both residential and nonresidential, such as manufacturing facilities, office buildings, schools, hospitals and churches.\\n\\n\\xa0\\\\* Data from 2022 10k and Annual Report\\n\\n[Meet Vulcan\\'s Leadership](https://ir.vulcanmaterials.com/governance/executive-management/default.aspx)\\n\\n[Vulcan Corporate Office](/about-vulcan/corporate-office)\\n\\n[Vulcan History](/about-vulcan/history)\\n\\n[Industry Links](/about-vulcan/industry-links)\\n\\n### [Contact](/contact)\\n\\n**Vulcan Materials Company**\\nCorporate Office\\n1200 Urban Center Drive\\nBirmingham, AL 35242\\nTel: (205\\\\) 298\\\\-3000\\n\\nPlease follow the hyperlinks to review the [Business Conduct Policy](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files.vulcanmaterials.com/vmc/Business-Conduct-Policy.pdf) or to report [concerns](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/16082/index.html).\\n\\nSiga los hipervínculos para revisar la\\xa0[Política de Conducta Empresarial](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files.vulcanmaterials.com/vmc/VMC-Business_Conduct_Policy_Spanish-2021.pdf)\\xa0o para reportar algún\\xa0[problema](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/es/gui/16082/index.html).\\n\\nContact us for\\xa0[Product Sales](/construction-materials/product-sales).\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/footer_aboutvulcan.png?sfvrsn=a4a41105_1)\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/footer_constructionmaterials.png?sfvrsn=c59fead5_1)\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/footer_investorrelations.png?sfvrsn=3d684e71_1)\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/social-responsibility-footer.jpg?sfvrsn=c6651106_1)\\n\\nAbout Vulcan\\n\\n* [History](/about-vulcan/history)\\n* [Mission and Values](/about-vulcan/mission-and-values)\\n* [Executive Management](/about-vulcan/executive-management)\\n* [Corporate Office](/about-vulcan/corporate-office)\\n* [Industry Links](/about-vulcan/industry-links)\\n* [Careers](/about-vulcan/careers)\\n\\nConstruction Materials\\n\\n* [MyVulcan](/construction-materials/myvulcan)\\n* [Product Sales](/construction-materials/product-sales)\\n* [Products and Services](/construction-materials/products-and-services)\\n* [Suppliers](/construction-materials/suppliers)\\n* [Facilities Map](/construction-materials/facilities-map)\\n* [Operating Groups](/construction-materials/operating-groups)\\n* [Product Calculators](/construction-materials/product-calculators)\\n* [Credit Applications](/construction-materials/credit-applications)\\n* [Safety Data Sheets](/construction-materials/safety-data-sheets)\\n* [Product Declaration](/construction-materials/product-declaration)\\n* [Facilities](/construction-materials/facilities)\\n\\nInvestor Relations\\n\\n* [Overview](/investor-relations/overview)\\n* [Why Invest](/investor-relations/why-invest)\\n* [News](/investor-relations/news)\\n* [Events \\\\& Presentations](/investor-relations/events-presentations)\\n* [Stock Info](/investor-relations/stock-info)\\n* [Financials](/investor-relations/financials)\\n* [Governance](/investor-relations/governance)\\n* [Link to Earnings Call](/investor-relations/link-to-earnings-call)\\n* [Link to 2022 Investor Day](/investor-relations/link-to-2022-investor-day)\\n\\nSocial Responsibility\\n\\n* [2023 Sustainability Report](/social-responsibility/2023-sustainability-report)\\n* [Safety \\\\& Health](/social-responsibility/safety-health)\\n* [Environmental Stewardship](/social-responsibility/environmental-stewardship)\\n* [People](/social-responsibility/people)\\n* [Community](/social-responsibility/community)\\n* [Governance](/social-responsibility/governance)\\n* [Teacher Center](/social-responsibility/teacher-center)\\n* [Vulcan Foundation](/social-responsibility/vulcan-foundation)\\n\\n* [Site Map](/site-map)\\n* [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use)\\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\\n* [California Residents\\' Privacy Notice](/california-privacy-notice)\\n* [Contact Us About Our Site](/contact)\\n© 2024 Vulcan Materials Company', 1, 0)</details></pre></div><div class='basic-renderer-box observation'><h4 class='step-header'>[16] Observation: ToolResult</h4><pre class='step-text'>tool_call_id: call_kiqWpbbKW4k3PpSLvxs8MO1t\n",
