    "**TapeAgents** is a framework that leverages a structured, replayable log (**Tape**) of the agent session to facilitate all stages of the LLM Agent development lifecycle. In TapeAgents, the agent reasons by processing the tape and the LLM output to produce new thoughts, actions, control flow steps and append them to the tape. The environment then reacts to the agent’s actions by likewise appending observation steps to the tape.\n",

    "Another way to help this agent (or one with an even smaller LLM) is to finetune the LLM. And the most important step towards finetuning is making the training data!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to make training data in TapeAgents:\n",
    "- the basic one: use the `LLMCall` structures that the agent created when it produced the tape. You can retrieve them from the SQLite storage and convert into training text.\n",
    "- the much powerful one: call `agent.reuse` to reconstructed the prompts and outputs **and** to validate that with the reconstructed LLMCalls the agent would indeed create the given tape\n",
    "\n",
    "The big advantage of the second approach is that it allows you to use the tape from a teacher agent (think slower and more expensive) to train a student agent (think faster and cheaper). Or to train an agent on its own revised tapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, restrictions apply: the tape by agent A may not be reusable by agent B directly. You might have to add/remove some steps. But at least `agent.reuse` verifies if your tape modifications led to creation of a tape that the agent B can indeed produce."

The company's products are used in a wide range of applications, including gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia's stock price has experienced significant volatility in recent years, with periods of both rapid growth and decline. This essay will examine the factors that have contributed to these fluctuations, with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic, low interest rates, and the demand for AI products.\\n\\nThe Impact of the Pandemic\\n\\nThe COVID\\\\-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Nvidia's stock price. In the early months of the pandemic, demand for Nvidia's products surged as people around the world were forced to stay home. This led to a sharp increase in Nvidia's stock price, which more than doubled in value between March and December of 2020\\\\.\\n\\nLow Interest Rates\\n\\nLow interest rates also played a role in the rise of Nvidia's stock price. Low interest rates make it cheaper for companies to borrow money, which can lead to increased investment and spending. This, in turn, can lead to higher demand for products and services, which can boost stock prices.\\n\\nDemand for AI Products\\n\\nThe demand for AI products has also been a major factor in the rise of Nvidia's stock price. AI is a rapidly growing field that requires specialized hardware, such as Nvidia's GPUs. The increasing demand for AI products has led to a surge in demand for Nvidia's products, which has helped to boost the company's stock price.\\n\\nThe Fall of Nvidia's Stock Price in 2022\\n\\nIn 2022, Nvidia's stock price experienced a significant decline. This decline can be attributed to a number of factors, including the rising cost of living, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the possibility of a global recession. These factors have led to a decrease in consumer spending and investment, which has hurt demand for Nvidia's products.\\n\\nThe stock price of Nvidia has been affected by a number of factors in recent years, including the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic, low interest rates, and the demand for AI products. The pandemic led to a surge in demand for Nvidia's products, while low interest rates made it cheaper for companies to invest in AI products. However, the rising cost of living, the war in Ukraine, and the possibility of a recession have led to a decline in demand for Nvidia's products in 2022\\\\.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\nRecommended by LinkedIn\\n-----------------------\\n\\n[![]()\\nIt’s Nvidia’s world, we just live in it\\n\\n John C Abell\\n\\n 5 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-nvidias-world-we-just-live-john-c-abell-lbkde)\\n\\n[![]()\\nNvidia is Diversifying to Dominate\\n\\n Mohamed Anis\\n\\n 6 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nvidia-doing-apple-diversifying-dominate-mohamed-anis-e6sle)\\n\\n[![]()\\nNvidia's 2008 Coming Out Party: Re\\\\-Visiting Its First…\\n\\n Chris O'Brien\\n\\n 6 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nvidias-2008-coming-out-party-re-visiting-its-first-nvision-o-brien-emm6e)\\n\\nLow Interest Rates and the Rise of Alternative Assets\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLow interest rates have been a key factor in the rise of Nvidia's stock price in recent years. When interest rates are low, it is cheaper for companies to borrow money, which can lead to increased investment and spending. This, in turn, can lead to higher demand for products and services, which can boost stock prices.\\n\\nAlternative Assets\\n\\nLow interest rates have also led to the rise of alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are not backed by any government or central bank. They have been gaining popularity in recent years as an alternative to traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds.\\n\\nExamples of Cryptocurrencies\\n\\nSome of the most popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Bitcoin is the oldest and most well\\\\-known cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of fraud or third party interference. Litecoin is a peer\\\\-to\\\\-peer cryptocurrency that was created in 2011 as a fork of Bitcoin.\\n\\nThe Rise of Cryptocurrencies\\n\\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies can be attributed to a number of factors, including:\\n\\n* Low interest rates:\\xa0As mentioned earlier, low interest rates make alternative investments with higher potential returns more attractive.\\n* Increasing demand for digital assets:\\xa0The digital world is expanding, and the demand for secure and efficient ways to transfer value online is growing.\\n* Growing popularity of blockchain technology:\\xa0Blockchain is the secure and transparent digital ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. Its potential applications beyond crypto have garnered interest.\\n\\nSpecific Dates of Cryptocurrency Price Increases\\n\\n* Bitcoin:\\xa0Bitcoin experienced a significant price increase in 2017, reaching a peak of around $20,000 USD in December. This surge was attributed to a combination of factors, including increased media attention and speculation from new investors.\\n* Ethereum:\\xa0Ethereum also saw a significant price increase in 2017, reaching a peak of around $1,400 USD in January. This growth was driven by the growing popularity of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum platform.\\n* Litecoin:\\xa0Litecoin's price also increased in 2017, reaching a peak of around $375 USD in December. However, its price increases were generally not as dramatic as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\\n\\nThe Impact of Cryptocurrencies on Nvidia's Stock Price\\n\\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has had a positive impact on Nvidia's stock price. Nvidia's GPUs are well\\\\-suited for mining cryptocurrencies, and the increased demand for mining power has led to an increase in the demand for Nvidia's products. This surge in demand has helped to boost the company's stock price.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nLow interest rates have played a significant role in the rise of Nvidia's stock price in recent years. They have led to increased investment and spending, as well as the rise of alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. The increased demand for cryptocurrencies, particularly for mining purposes, has further boosted the demand for Nvidia's GPUs, contributing positively to the company's stock price.\\n\\n[Porandu](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/porandu-6983845667823599616)\\n![Porandu]()\\n\\n ### Porandu\\n\\n#### 2,440 followers\\n\\n[\\\\+

The company's products are used in a wide range of applications, including gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia's stock price has experienced significant volatility in recent years, with periods of both rapid growth and decline. This essay will examine the factors that have contributed to these fluctuations, with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic, low interest rates, and the demand for AI products.\\n\\nThe Impact of the Pandemic\\n\\nThe COVID\\\\-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Nvidia's stock price. In the early months of the pandemic, demand for Nvidia's products surged as people around the world were forced to stay home. This led to a sharp increase in Nvidia's stock price, which more than doubled in value between March and December of 2020\\\\.\\n\\nLow Interest Rates\\n\\nLow interest rates also played a role in the rise of Nvidia's stock price. Low interest rates make it cheaper for companies to borrow money, which can lead to increased investment and spending. This, in turn, can lead to higher demand for products and services, which can boost stock prices.\\n\\nDemand for AI Products\\n\\nThe demand for AI products has also been a major factor in the rise of Nvidia's stock price. AI is a rapidly growing field that requires specialized hardware, such as Nvidia's GPUs. The increasing demand for AI products has led to a surge in demand for Nvidia's products, which has helped to boost the company's stock price.\\n\\nThe Fall of Nvidia's Stock Price in 2022\\n\\nIn 2022, Nvidia's stock price experienced a significant decline. This decline can be attributed to a number of factors, including the rising cost of living, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the possibility of a global recession. These factors have led to a decrease in consumer spending and investment, which has hurt demand for Nvidia's products.\\n\\nThe stock price of Nvidia has been affected by a number of factors in recent years, including the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic, low interest rates, and the demand for AI products. The pandemic led to a surge in demand for Nvidia's products, while low interest rates made it cheaper for companies to invest in AI products. However, the rising cost of living, the war in Ukraine, and the possibility of a recession have led to a decline in demand for Nvidia's products in 2022\\\\.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nSource: own elaboration based on public data.\\n\\nRecommended by LinkedIn\\n-----------------------\\n\\n[![]()\\nIt’s Nvidia’s world, we just live in it\\n\\n John C Abell\\n\\n 5 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-nvidias-world-we-just-live-john-c-abell-lbkde)\\n\\n[![]()\\nNvidia is Diversifying to Dominate\\n\\n Mohamed Anis\\n\\n 6 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nvidia-doing-apple-diversifying-dominate-mohamed-anis-e6sle)\\n\\n[![]()\\nNvidia's 2008 Coming Out Party: Re\\\\-Visiting Its First…\\n\\n Chris O'Brien\\n\\n 6 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nvidias-2008-coming-out-party-re-visiting-its-first-nvision-o-brien-emm6e)\\n\\nLow Interest Rates and the Rise of Alternative Assets\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLow interest rates have been a key factor in the rise of Nvidia's stock price in recent years. When interest rates are low, it is cheaper for companies to borrow money, which can lead to increased investment and spending. This, in turn, can lead to higher demand for products and services, which can boost stock prices.\\n\\nAlternative Assets\\n\\nLow interest rates have also led to the rise of alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are not backed by any government or central bank. They have been gaining popularity in recent years as an alternative to traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds.\\n\\nExamples of Cryptocurrencies\\n\\nSome of the most popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Bitcoin is the oldest and most well\\\\-known cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of fraud or third party interference. Litecoin is a peer\\\\-to\\\\-peer cryptocurrency that was created in 2011 as a fork of Bitcoin.\\n\\nThe Rise of Cryptocurrencies\\n\\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies can be attributed to a number of factors, including:\\n\\n* Low interest rates:\\xa0As mentioned earlier, low interest rates make alternative investments with higher potential returns more attractive.\\n* Increasing demand for digital assets:\\xa0The digital world is expanding, and the demand for secure and efficient ways to transfer value online is growing.\\n* Growing popularity of blockchain technology:\\xa0Blockchain is the secure and transparent digital ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. Its potential applications beyond crypto have garnered interest.\\n\\nSpecific Dates of Cryptocurrency Price Increases\\n\\n* Bitcoin:\\xa0Bitcoin experienced a significant price increase in 2017, reaching a peak of around $20,000 USD in December. This surge was attributed to a combination of factors, including increased media attention and speculation from new investors.\\n* Ethereum:\\xa0Ethereum also saw a significant price increase in 2017, reaching a peak of around $1,400 USD in January. This growth was driven by the growing popularity of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum platform.\\n* Litecoin:\\xa0Litecoin's price also increased in 2017, reaching a peak of around $375 USD in December. However, its price increases were generally not as dramatic as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\\n\\nThe Impact of Cryptocurrencies on Nvidia's Stock Price\\n\\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has had a positive impact on Nvidia's stock price. Nvidia's GPUs are well\\\\-suited for mining cryptocurrencies, and the increased demand for mining power has led to an increase in the demand for Nvidia's products. This surge in demand has helped to boost the company's stock price.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nLow interest rates have played a significant role in the rise of Nvidia's stock price in recent years. They have led to increased investment and spending, as well as the rise of alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. The increased demand for cryptocurrencies, particularly for mining purposes, has further boosted the demand for Nvidia's GPUs, contributing positively to the company's stock price.\\n\\n[Porandu](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/porandu-6983845667823599616)\\n![Porandu]()\\n\\n ### Porandu\\n\\n#### 2,440 followers\\n\\n[\\\\+

Materials\\' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Results and activities in the third quarter evidence the consistent execution of our two\\\\-pronged strategy to generate durable growth. \\xa0We continue to enhance our core through expansion of our industry\\\\-leading aggregates cash gross profit per ton, which increased 10 percent in the third quarter and has grown by double\\\\-digits for eight consecutive quarters.\\xa0 We also recently announced the acquisition of Wake Stone Corporation, a leading pure\\\\-play aggregates producer, that will expand our reach in high\\\\-growth geographies in the Carolinas.\\xa0 Our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines remain fundamental to compounding profitability across our franchise and successfully integrating new operations.\"\\n\\n**Third Quarter Segment Results**\\n\\n**Aggregates**Third quarter segment gross profit was $498 million ($8\\\\.63 per ton), and gross profit margin expanded 40 basis points.\\xa0 Cash gross profit per ton improved 10 percent to $10\\\\.89 per ton, despite lower shipments and harsh weather conditions throughout the quarter.\\xa0 Improvements in unit profitability were widespread across the Company\\'s footprint.\\n\\nAggregates shipments decreased 10 percent as compared to the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\xa0 Shipments across the Southeast were impacted by significant rainfall in July, followed by numerous hurricanes and severe storms in August and September.\\xa0 The prior year\\'s third quarter included fewer severe weather events.\\n\\nThe pricing environment remained positive across the footprint.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted selling prices increased 10 percent as compared to the prior year.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted unit cash cost of sales was negatively impacted by lower volume and challenging weather\\\\-affected operating conditions; freight\\\\-adjusted cash cost of sales dollars remained flat compared to the prior year.\\n\\n**Asphalt and Concrete**Asphalt segment gross profit was $60 million, and cash gross profit was $72 million, a 12 percent improvement over the prior year.\\xa0 Shipments increased slightly as compared to the prior year, and price improved 6 percent.\\xa0 Concrete segment gross profit was $7 million, and cash gross profit was $17 million.\\xa0 The prior year\\'s third quarter included results from the previously divested concrete assets in Texas, which accounted for the majority of the year\\\\-over\\\\-year decline in cash gross profit.\\n\\n**Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) and Other Items**SAG expense was $129 million compared to $144 million in the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\xa0 As a percent of total revenues, SAG expense was 6\\\\.4 percent and 20 basis points lower than the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\n\\nThis year\\'s third quarter included a pretax charge of $87 million ($84 million after\\\\-tax) resulting from the write\\\\-off of goodwill for the Company\\'s concrete assets in Northern California.\\n\\n**Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation**The Company remains well positioned for continued growth with a strong liquidity position and balance sheet profile.\\xa0 As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total debt to trailing\\\\-twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was 1\\\\.7 times and below the Company\\'s target range of 2\\\\.0 to 2\\\\.5 times.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, return on invested capital improved 70 basis points over the prior year to 16\\\\.1 percent.\\n\\nCapital expenditures were $104 million in the third quarter and $402 million on a year\\\\-to\\\\-date basis.\\xa0 For the full year, the Company expects to spend between $625 and $650 million for maintenance and growth projects. \\xa0During the quarter, the Company returned $61 million to shareholders through dividends, a 6 percent increase versus the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Wake Stone Corporation is consistent with our disciplined capital allocation priorities and aggregates\\\\-led strategy of continuing to expand our reach to better serve more high\\\\-growth regions in the United States.\\xa0 The acquisition is expected to provide more than 60 years of quality hard rock reserves. \\xa0The Company expects to close the transaction during the fourth quarter of this year, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\\n\\n**Outlook**Regarding the Company\\'s current year outlook, Mr. Hill said, \"While significant weather disruptions have impacted construction activity through the first nine months of the year, overall demand fundamentals continue to underpin long\\\\-term growth.\\xa0 The pricing environment remains positive, and we continue to execute well.\\xa0 Given the decline in shipments to date and continued weather events so far in the fourth quarter, we now expect full\\\\-year Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion.\\n\\nMr. Hill continued, \"As we look to 2025, we expect aggregates price to improve high\\\\-single digits, cost to benefit from our Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines and moderating inflation and, most importantly, cash gross profit per ton to continue expanding at double\\\\-digit levels.\\xa0 A demand backdrop underpinned by growth in public construction activity and an improving private demand environment should lead to volume growth in 2025\\\\.\\xa0 Our steadfast focus to execute at the highest level – both commercially and operationally – positions us well to capitalize on improving volume and grow earnings.\"\\n\\n**Conference Call**Vulcan will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. CT on October 30, 2024\\\\.\\xa0 A webcast will be available via the Company\\'s website at [www.vulcanmaterials.com](http://www.vulcanmaterials.com).\\xa0 Investors and other interested parties may access the teleconference live by calling 800\\\\-274\\\\-8461, or

Materials\\' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Results and activities in the third quarter evidence the consistent execution of our two\\\\-pronged strategy to generate durable growth. \\xa0We continue to enhance our core through expansion of our industry\\\\-leading aggregates cash gross profit per ton, which increased 10 percent in the third quarter and has grown by double\\\\-digits for eight consecutive quarters.\\xa0 We also recently announced the acquisition of Wake Stone Corporation, a leading pure\\\\-play aggregates producer, that will expand our reach in high\\\\-growth geographies in the Carolinas.\\xa0 Our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines remain fundamental to compounding profitability across our franchise and successfully integrating new operations.\"\\n\\n**Third Quarter Segment Results**\\n\\n**Aggregates**Third quarter segment gross profit was $498 million ($8\\\\.63 per ton), and gross profit margin expanded 40 basis points.\\xa0 Cash gross profit per ton improved 10 percent to $10\\\\.89 per ton, despite lower shipments and harsh weather conditions throughout the quarter.\\xa0 Improvements in unit profitability were widespread across the Company\\'s footprint.\\n\\nAggregates shipments decreased 10 percent as compared to the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\xa0 Shipments across the Southeast were impacted by significant rainfall in July, followed by numerous hurricanes and severe storms in August and September.\\xa0 The prior year\\'s third quarter included fewer severe weather events.\\n\\nThe pricing environment remained positive across the footprint.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted selling prices increased 10 percent as compared to the prior year.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted unit cash cost of sales was negatively impacted by lower volume and challenging weather\\\\-affected operating conditions; freight\\\\-adjusted cash cost of sales dollars remained flat compared to the prior year.\\n\\n**Asphalt and Concrete**Asphalt segment gross profit was $60 million, and cash gross profit was $72 million, a 12 percent improvement over the prior year.\\xa0 Shipments increased slightly as compared to the prior year, and price improved 6 percent.\\xa0 Concrete segment gross profit was $7 million, and cash gross profit was $17 million.\\xa0 The prior year\\'s third quarter included results from the previously divested concrete assets in Texas, which accounted for the majority of the year\\\\-over\\\\-year decline in cash gross profit.\\n\\n**Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) and Other Items**SAG expense was $129 million compared to $144 million in the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\xa0 As a percent of total revenues, SAG expense was 6\\\\.4 percent and 20 basis points lower than the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\n\\nThis year\\'s third quarter included a pretax charge of $87 million ($84 million after\\\\-tax) resulting from the write\\\\-off of goodwill for the Company\\'s concrete assets in Northern California.\\n\\n**Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation**The Company remains well positioned for continued growth with a strong liquidity position and balance sheet profile.\\xa0 As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total debt to trailing\\\\-twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was 1\\\\.7 times and below the Company\\'s target range of 2\\\\.0 to 2\\\\.5 times.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, return on invested capital improved 70 basis points over the prior year to 16\\\\.1 percent.\\n\\nCapital expenditures were $104 million in the third quarter and $402 million on a year\\\\-to\\\\-date basis.\\xa0 For the full year, the Company expects to spend between $625 and $650 million for maintenance and growth projects. \\xa0During the quarter, the Company returned $61 million to shareholders through dividends, a 6 percent increase versus the prior year\\'s third quarter.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Wake Stone Corporation is consistent with our disciplined capital allocation priorities and aggregates\\\\-led strategy of continuing to expand our reach to better serve more high\\\\-growth regions in the United States.\\xa0 The acquisition is expected to provide more than 60 years of quality hard rock reserves. \\xa0The Company expects to close the transaction during the fourth quarter of this year, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\\n\\n**Outlook**Regarding the Company\\'s current year outlook, Mr. Hill said, \"While significant weather disruptions have impacted construction activity through the first nine months of the year, overall demand fundamentals continue to underpin long\\\\-term growth.\\xa0 The pricing environment remains positive, and we continue to execute well.\\xa0 Given the decline in shipments to date and continued weather events so far in the fourth quarter, we now expect full\\\\-year Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion.\\n\\nMr. Hill continued, \"As we look to 2025, we expect aggregates price to improve high\\\\-single digits, cost to benefit from our Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines and moderating inflation and, most importantly, cash gross profit per ton to continue expanding at double\\\\-digit levels.\\xa0 A demand backdrop underpinned by growth in public construction activity and an improving private demand environment should lead to volume growth in 2025\\\\.\\xa0 Our steadfast focus to execute at the highest level – both commercially and operationally – positions us well to capitalize on improving volume and grow earnings.\"\\n\\n**Conference Call**Vulcan will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. CT on October 30, 2024\\\\.\\xa0 A webcast will be available via the
