When TapeAgents runs a node, it uses its two main functions: `make_prompt` to create LLM Prompt from the tape and `generate_steps` to create new steps from the LLM output. To build a node, you can subclass `Node` and override these functions. Note that `generate_steps` must be a generator, a design choice we made to make TapeAgents a streaming-friendly framework. \n",

First, I will use the `get_stock_ticker` function to retrieve the stock ticker symbol for Vulcan Materials Company by passing \\\"Vulcan Materials\\\" as the `company_name` parameter.\\n\\n2. Once I have the ticker symbol, I will use the `get_stock_data` function to retrieve the historical stock prices for Vulcan Materials within a relevant time range, such as the past year, by passing the ticker symbol, start date, and end date as parameters.\\n\\n3. Next, I will analyze the retrieved stock data to identify trends, patterns, and notable events that may have affected the company's stock performance.\\n\\n4. I will then use the analyzed data to provide the user with a concise summary of Vulcan Materials' current stock performance and any relevant insights into the company's financial health.\\n\\n5. To provide a more comprehensive overview, I may also provide additional information about Vulcan Materials, such as its industry, market capitalization, and recent news or announcements that may be affecting its stock price.\\n\\n6. Finally, I will present the information in a clear and easy-to-understand format, using natural language and avoiding technical jargon, to help the user gain a better understanding of Vulcan Materials' financial situation.\",\n",

The company's market capitalization is around 18 billion USD.

Nvidia briefly surpassed Microsoft and Apple midweek to become the world\\'s most valuable company but slipped back to third place by Friday\\'s close. Investors are now debating whether to take profits on NVDA and the broader AI sector or stick with the theme that has driven most of this year\\'s S\\\\&P 500 gains.\\n\\nFirst, the recent 7% dip should be taken into context. Nvidia shares are still up 156% year to date, and last week\\'s dip is relatively minor and barely shows up on a long\\\\-term chart. Investors should expect dramatic and painful drawdowns from companies that have moved so far so fast. Nvidia is no exception. Its shares fell by 66% at one point in 2022 and have had four drawdowns of approximately 15% or more in the last year alone.\\n\\nNVDA stock price\\n\\nGarth Friesen\\n\\nStill, several concerns are causing investors to reevaluate their faith in the Nvidia rally. Gaining the status as the world\\'s most valuable company when the overall economy appears to be losing momentum is one obvious worry. The extreme [domination of large\\\\-cap technology stocks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/2024/06/17/microsoft-nvidia-and-apples-index-dominance-reaches-alarming-level/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/2024/06/17/microsoft-nvidia-and-apples-index-dominance-reaches-alarming-level/\") at the index level is another. Also, the significant outperformance of AI\\\\-related stocks in the last month relative to the rest of the market has once again prompted talk of bubble\\\\-like price action. These concerns provide an opportunity to pause and look at Nvidia from a larger perspective. Is a bubble forming, or is the share price appreciation warranted?\\n\\nThere are some standard definitions of a stock or stock market bubble, primarily using history is a guide. Typical characteristics are rapid and substantial price increases that outpace reasonable valuations; widespread investor enthusiasm and speculation, often accompanied by a fear of missing out and speculative behavior; and a belief in new paradigms, technologies, or economic conditions that create excitement about future growth prospects.\\n\\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR[### Best High\\\\-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23\")[ByKevin PayneContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/ \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/\")[### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23\")[ByCassidy HortonContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton\")\\nRapid And Substantial Price Appreciation\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nNvidia and other AI stocks have rocketed higher in the last 18 months. Nvidia has soared nearly 800% since the start of 2023 and other tech giants like Meta (\\\\+297%), Amazon (\\\\+120%) and Microsoft (\\\\+88%) have done the same. However, the near\\\\-parabolic rise is not without fundamental support. Nvidia continues to exceed analysts\\' expectations of earnings and profit growth and boasts an estimated market share of 80% in specialized chips needed for most AI applications. The other technology leaders are also delivering earnings growth above what many thought possible.\\n\\nSpecifically, [Nvidia’s financial results for the first quarter](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025 \"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025\") of fiscal year 2025 showed revenue growth of 262% compared to a year ago. Data center growth was even more impressive, climbing 427% from last year. With gross margins of 78%, profits are following suit. Clearly, there is more to Nvidia than pure speculation.\\n\\n1\\\\-year forward P/E multiple for Nvidia and and Nasdaq 100\\n\\nGarth Friesen; Bloomberg LP\\n\\nFrom a valuation perspective, Nvidia is not cheap. According to *Bloomberg* data, NVDA’s one\\\\-year forward price\\\\-to\\\\-earnings ratio is 47x, compared to 35\\\\.9x for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, 29x for the NASDAQ 100 Index, 22\\\\.6x for the S\\\\&P 500, and 17\\\\.8x for the equal\\\\-weight S\\\\&P 500 Index. Yes, Nvidia is expensive relative to the broader market, but that is to be expected given the rapid growth in revenue and earnings. Investors are willing to pay up for growth, and Nvidia is delivering. Applying traditional valuation metrics to fast\\\\-growing companies in relatively new industries is often futile. But are the current multiples too extreme?\\n\\nBy comparison, during the [peak of the dot\\\\-com bubble in 2000](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-tech-stocks-in-a-bubble \"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-tech-stocks-in-a-bubble\"), Nasdaq 100 stocks traded at an absurd trailing P/E of 200, more than six times today\\'s level. Cisco, a poster child of the dot\\\\-com era, was valued at a multiple of more than 150 times forward earnings when the stock hit its peak in March 2000\\\\. In this context, neither Nvidia nor the broader market are near the valuation levels seen during the internet bubble. However, Nvidia’s recent earnings and sales multiple expansion suggests a disconnect between the share price and performance of the underlying business. AI stocks have spiked, and valuations have stretched, but at least some fundamental support is behind the craze.\\n\\nIf rating its rapid price appreciation bubble on a scale of 1 to 10, the score is likely a seven.\\n\\nWidespread Investor Enthusiasm And Speculation\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother potential sign of a bubble is extreme euphoria and speculation surrounding a stock or a theme.\\n\\nThe options market is one place to look for excessive sentiment. Stocks or sectors where call option volatility is trading higher than put option volatility is often a sign that investors expect significant upside from existing levels. Currently, 1\\\\-month and 3\\\\-month call options have roughly the same level of implied volatility as put options. This is consistent with market pricing over the last year. Call options were more expensive last March around the earnings report. Today, there does not appear to be extreme bullishness in the options market.\\n\\nStill, everyone is watching the AI boom. Public company mentions of AI in earnings calls are at a record high. Roughly [40% of S\\\\&P 500 discussed AI](https://sherwood.news/business/number-of-s-and-p-500-companies-mentioning-ai-hits-record/ \"https://sherwood.news/business/number-of-s-and-p-500-companies-mentioning-ai-hits-record/\") on their earnings calls this past quarter — up from 1% five years ago, according to data from FactSet. Most of these companies cite AI as a potential productivity booster rather than an additional source of revenue, and many are making substantial investments in the technology. There is widespread enthusiasm about AI, but it should not be considered speculation since productivity improvements have already been established.\\n\\nA potentially worrisome sign would be a rush of new companies tapping the public markets to raise money for anything related to AI, similar to the internet bubble where investors scrambled to buy anything with \".com\" in the name. According to Bloomberg, total initial public offerings are running at about $16 billion in proceeds raised year\\\\-to\\\\-date versus about $20 billion for all of 2023\\\\. In terms of deal count, there have been [88 IPOs through mid\\\\-June 2024](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/statistics/ \"https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/statistics/\"), compared to 154 in 2023\\\\. The record was set in 2021 with 1035 IPOs. If there was an AI startup bubble, it peaked in 2021\\\\.\\n\\nIf rating the level of speculation in Nvidia to past bubbles on a scale of 1 to 10, the score is probably a six.\\n\\nBelief In New Paradigms\\n-----------------------\\n\\nAI is not the first technology to induce predictions of a materially altered future. Crypto was supposed to be the future of finance, and 3\\\\-D printing was expected to revolutionize manufacturing. Neither crypto nor 3\\\\-D printing has lived up to the initial hype. AI may fall into the same category, but there are reasons to believe it will indeed have a material impact on economics and society.\\n\\nBig technology firms and dozens of large corporations are making huge investments in the space. Hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into Nvidia\\'s chips and AI\\\\-related infrastructure, such as data centers and the electrical grid. These investments are already paying off in direct AI revenue and [enhanced productivity](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/AI-is-showing-very-positive-signs-of-boosting-gdp.html \"https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/AI-is-showing-very-positive-signs-of-boosting-gdp.html\").\\n\\nAccording to a [recent PwC report](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html \"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html\"), AI is predicted to increase productivity, raise growth domestic product growth, contribute to scientific discovery, and improve the healthcare system. The study predicts AI has the potential to contribute 14%, or $15\\\\.7 trillion, to the global economy by 2030\\\\. These are lofty predictions and very well may materialize. However, the fact that these studies are becoming more prevalent indicates belief that a new paradigm has formed.\\n\\nA number of changing circumstances could quickly alter the impact of this new paradigm. Shifts in global trade policy, emerging new technologies and competitors, a markdown in global growth expectations, or geopolitical shocks are just a few examples. AI could have a significant impact on many aspects of society, but it is possible that the return on investment will fail to materialize. Regardless of the outcome, investors are betting on, and talking about, a “new future.”\\n\\nWhen comparing the level of belief in a new paradigm to past bubbles on a scale of 1 to 10, the score would likely be an eight.\\n\\nNvidia Is Not In A Bubble But It Is Not Without Risk\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNvidia has become larger than the respective stock markets of Germany, France, and the U.K. Nvidia and other companies directly benefiting from AI are now at valuation levels that offer little room for error, and they must continue surpassing expectations and maintaining their market leadership to justify their current price.\\n\\nIs there a risk of another drawdown similar in magnitude to the ones we have witnessed over the last year? Absolutely. But is there a bubble\\\\-bursting crash in all AI\\\\-related stocks around the corner? Likely not. According to standard definitions of a bubble, Nvidia does not appear to be in the late stages of a one: valuations are high, but not at extreme levels; enthusiasm about AI is widespread, but not without fundamental support; and AI has already started to deliver on some of the lofty expectations in terms of new applications and overall productivity, validating predictions of a new paradigm.\\n\\nFollow me on\\xa0[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Garth_Friesen)\\xa0or\\xa0[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garthfriesen).\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0[website](https://www.garthfriesen.com).\\xa0[![Garth Friesen](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/garthfriesen/files/2017/08/Garth-Friesen_avatar_1503528310-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/ \"Photo of Garth Friesen\")[Garth Friesen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/\")[Following](https://account.forbes.com/following \"https://account.forbes.com/following\")* [Editorial Standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/)\\n* [Forbes Accolades](https://www.forbes.com/accolades/)\\n\\n### Join The Conversation\\n\\nComments\\xa0One Community.

Nvidia shares are still up 156% year to date, and last week\\'s dip is relatively minor and barely shows up on a long\\\\-term chart. Investors should expect dramatic and painful drawdowns from companies that have moved so far so fast. Nvidia is no exception. Its shares fell by 66% at one point in 2022 and have had four drawdowns of approximately 15% or more in the last year alone.\\n\\nNVDA stock price\\n\\nGarth Friesen\\n\\nStill, several concerns are causing investors to reevaluate their faith in the Nvidia rally. Gaining the status as the world\\'s most valuable company when the overall economy appears to be losing momentum is one obvious worry. The extreme [domination of large\\\\-cap technology stocks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/2024/06/17/microsoft-nvidia-and-apples-index-dominance-reaches-alarming-level/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/2024/06/17/microsoft-nvidia-and-apples-index-dominance-reaches-alarming-level/\") at the index level is another. Also, the significant outperformance of AI\\\\-related stocks in the last month relative to the rest of the market has once again prompted talk of bubble\\\\-like price action. These concerns provide an opportunity to pause and look at Nvidia from a larger perspective. Is a bubble forming, or is the share price appreciation warranted?\\n\\nThere are some standard definitions of a stock or stock market bubble, primarily using history is a guide. Typical characteristics are rapid and substantial price increases that outpace reasonable valuations; widespread investor enthusiasm and speculation, often accompanied by a fear of missing out and speculative behavior; and a belief in new paradigms, technologies, or economic conditions that create excitement about future growth prospects.\\n\\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR[### Best High\\\\-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23\")[ByKevin PayneContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/ \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/\")[### Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23\")[ByCassidy HortonContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton\")\\nRapid And Substantial Price Appreciation\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nNvidia and other AI stocks have rocketed higher in the last 18 months. Nvidia has soared nearly 800% since the start of 2023 and other tech giants like Meta (\\\\+297%), Amazon (\\\\+120%) and Microsoft (\\\\+88%) have done the same. However, the near\\\\-parabolic rise is not without fundamental support. Nvidia continues to exceed analysts\\' expectations of earnings and profit growth and boasts an estimated market share of 80% in specialized chips needed for most AI applications. The other technology leaders are also delivering earnings growth above what many thought possible.\\n\\nSpecifically, [Nvidia’s financial results for the first quarter](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025 \"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025\") of fiscal year 2025 showed revenue growth of 262% compared to a year ago. Data center growth was even more impressive, climbing 427% from last year. With gross margins of 78%, profits are following suit. Clearly, there is more to Nvidia than pure speculation.\\n\\n1\\\\-year forward P/E multiple for Nvidia and and Nasdaq 100\\n\\nGarth Friesen; Bloomberg LP\\n\\nFrom a valuation perspective, Nvidia is not cheap. According to *Bloomberg* data, NVDA’s one\\\\-year forward price\\\\-to\\\\-earnings ratio is 47x, compared to 35\\\\.9x for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, 29x for the NASDAQ 100 Index, 22\\\\.6x for the S\\\\&P 500, and 17\\\\.8x for the equal\\\\-weight S\\\\&P 500 Index. Yes, Nvidia is expensive relative to the broader market, but that is to be expected given the rapid growth in revenue and earnings. Investors are willing to pay up for growth, and Nvidia is delivering. Applying traditional valuation metrics to fast\\\\-growing companies in relatively new industries is often futile. But are the current multiples too extreme?\\n\\nBy comparison, during the [peak of the dot\\\\-com bubble in 2000](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-tech-stocks-in-a-bubble \"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-tech-stocks-in-a-bubble\"), Nasdaq 100 stocks traded at an absurd trailing P/E of 200, more than six times today\\'s level. Cisco, a poster child of the dot\\\\-com era, was valued at a multiple of more than 150 times forward earnings when the stock hit its peak in March 2000\\\\. In this context, neither Nvidia nor the broader market are near the valuation levels seen during the internet bubble. However, Nvidia’s recent earnings and sales multiple expansion suggests a disconnect between the share price and performance of the underlying business. AI stocks have spiked, and valuations have stretched, but at least some fundamental support is behind the craze.\\n\\nIf rating its rapid price appreciation bubble on a scale of 1 to 10, the score is likely a seven.\\n\\nWidespread Investor Enthusiasm And Speculation\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nAnother potential sign of a bubble is extreme euphoria and speculation surrounding a stock or a theme.\\n\\nThe options market is one place to look for excessive sentiment. Stocks or sectors where call option volatility is trading higher than put option volatility is often a sign that investors expect significant upside from existing levels. Currently, 1\\\\-month and 3\\\\-month call options have roughly the same level of implied volatility as put options. This is consistent with market pricing over the last year. Call options were more expensive last March around the earnings report. Today, there does not appear to be extreme bullishness in the options market.\\n\\nStill, everyone is watching the AI boom. Public company mentions of AI in earnings calls are at a record high. Roughly [40% of S\\\\&P 500 discussed AI](https://sherwood.news/business/number-of-s-and-p-500-companies-mentioning-ai-hits-record/ \"https://sherwood.news/business/number-of-s-and-p-500-companies-mentioning-ai-hits-record/\") on their earnings calls this past quarter — up from 1% five years ago, according to data from FactSet. Most of these companies cite AI as a potential productivity booster rather than an additional source of revenue, and many are making substantial investments in the technology. There is widespread enthusiasm about AI, but it should not be considered speculation since productivity improvements have already been established.\\n\\nA potentially worrisome sign would be a rush of new companies tapping the public markets to raise money for anything related to AI, similar to the internet bubble where investors scrambled to buy anything with \".com\" in the name. According to Bloomberg, total initial public offerings are running at about $16 billion in proceeds raised year\\\\-to\\\\-date versus about $20 billion for all of 2023\\\\. In terms of deal count, there have been [88 IPOs through mid\\\\-June 2024](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/statistics/ \"https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/statistics/\"), compared to 154 in 2023\\\\. The record was set in 2021 with 1035 IPOs. If there was an AI startup bubble, it peaked in 2021\\\\.\\n\\nIf rating the level of speculation in Nvidia to past bubbles on a scale of 1 to 10, the score is probably a six.\\n\\nBelief In New Paradigms\\n-----------------------\\n\\nAI is not the first technology to induce predictions of a materially altered future. Crypto was supposed to be the future of finance, and 3\\\\-D printing was expected to revolutionize manufacturing. Neither crypto nor 3\\\\-D printing has lived up to the initial hype. AI may fall into the same category, but there are reasons to believe it will indeed have a material impact on economics and society.\\n\\nBig technology firms and dozens of large corporations are making huge investments in the space. Hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into Nvidia\\'s chips and AI\\\\-related infrastructure, such as data centers and the electrical grid. These investments are already paying off in direct AI revenue and [enhanced productivity](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/AI-is-showing-very-positive-signs-of-boosting-gdp.html \"https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/AI-is-showing-very-positive-signs-of-boosting-gdp.html\").\\n\\nAccording to a [recent PwC report](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html \"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html\"), AI is predicted to increase productivity, raise growth domestic product growth, contribute to scientific discovery, and improve the healthcare system. The study predicts AI has the potential to contribute 14%, or $15\\\\.7 trillion, to the global economy by 2030\\\\. These are lofty predictions and very well may materialize. However, the fact that these studies are becoming more prevalent indicates belief that a new paradigm has formed.\\n\\nA number of changing circumstances could quickly alter the impact of this new paradigm. Shifts in global trade policy, emerging new technologies and competitors, a markdown in global growth expectations, or geopolitical shocks are just a few examples. AI could have a significant impact on many aspects of society, but it is possible that the return on investment will fail to materialize. Regardless of the outcome, investors are betting on, and talking about, a “new future.”\\n\\nWhen comparing the level of belief in a new paradigm to past bubbles on a scale of 1 to 10, the score would likely be an eight.\\n\\nNvidia Is Not In A Bubble But It Is Not Without Risk\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNvidia has become larger than the respective stock markets of Germany, France, and the U.K. Nvidia and other companies directly benefiting from AI are now at valuation levels that offer little room for error, and they must continue surpassing expectations and maintaining their market leadership to justify their current price.\\n\\nIs there a risk of another drawdown similar in magnitude to the ones we have witnessed over the last year? Absolutely. But is there a bubble\\\\-bursting crash in all AI\\\\-related stocks around the corner? Likely not. According to standard definitions of a bubble, Nvidia does not appear to be in the late stages of a one: valuations are high, but not at extreme levels; enthusiasm about AI is widespread, but not without fundamental support; and AI has already started to deliver on some of the lofty expectations in terms of new applications and overall productivity, validating predictions of a new paradigm.\\n\\nFollow me on\\xa0[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Garth_Friesen)\\xa0or\\xa0[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garthfriesen).\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0[website](https://www.garthfriesen.com).\\xa0[![Garth Friesen](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/garthfriesen/files/2017/08/Garth-Friesen_avatar_1503528310-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/ \"Photo of Garth Friesen\")[Garth Friesen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/\")[Following](https://account.forbes.com/following \"https://account.forbes.com/following\")* [Editorial Standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/)\\n* [Forbes Accolades](https://www.forbes.com/accolades/)\\n\\n### Join The Conversation\\n\\nComments\\xa0One Community.

solid execution helped us overcome challenging weather conditions throughout much of the first quarter.\\xa0 Margins expanded despite lower aggregates shipments, demonstrating the durability of our aggregates business and its attractive compounding growth characteristics.\\xa0 Aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased 10 percent in the first quarter, with improvements widespread across our footprint.\\xa0 A consistent focus on our strategic disciplines coupled with continued pricing momentum reinforces our confidence in our full year outlook and our ability to deliver another year of double\\\\-digit earnings growth and strong cash generation.\"\\n\\n**First Quarter Segment Results**\\n\\n**Aggregates**Segment gross profit was $303 million ($6\\\\.30 per ton).\\xa0 Cash gross profit per ton improved 10 percent to $8\\\\.86 per ton, despite lower shipments due to unfavorable weather conditions throughout most of the quarter.\\xa0 Improvements in unit profitability were widespread across the Company\\'s footprint and resulted from continued pricing momentum and solid operational execution.\\n\\nPrice increases effective at the beginning of the year resulted in another quarter of attractive growth.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted selling prices increased 10 percent versus the prior year, with all markets realizing year\\\\-over\\\\-year improvement.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 10 percent, primarily driven by a 7 percent decline in aggregates shipments due to unfavorable weather.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, unit cash cost increased 9 percent, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of unit cost deceleration.\\n\\n**Asphalt and Concrete**Asphalt segment gross profit was $5 million, and cash gross profit was $14 million, a 39 percent improvement over the prior year.\\xa0 Shipments increased 3 percent, and price improved 6 percent.\\xa0 Strong shipments in Arizona and California, the Company\\'s largest asphalt markets, were partially offset by lower shipments in Texas due to weather impacts.\\xa0 Concrete segment gross profit was a loss of $3 million. \\xa0Cash gross profit was $9 million, and unit cash gross profit improved 10 percent despite lower volumes.\\xa0 The prior year included results from the previously divested concrete assets in Texas.\\n\\n**Selling, Administrative and General (SAG)**SAG expense of $130 million was in line with the Company\\'s expectations for the first quarter.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, SAG expense was $555 million, or 7\\\\.2 percent of total revenues.\\n\\n**Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation**Capital expenditures were $103 million in the first quarter.\\xa0 For the full year, the Company expects to spend $625 to $675 million for maintenance and growth projects. \\xa0During the quarter, the Company returned $81 million to shareholders through $19 million of common stock repurchases and $62 million of dividends.\\xa0 The Company also used $550 million of cash on hand to redeem its 2026 notes, resulting in a ratio of total debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 1\\\\.7 times, or 1\\\\.5 times on a net basis reflecting $300 million of cash on hand.\\xa0 A strong liquidity and balance sheet profile positions the Company well for continued growth.\\xa0 The Company\\'s weighted\\\\-average debt maturity was 11 years, and the effective weighted\\\\-average interest rate was 4\\\\.8 percent.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, return on average invested capital was 16\\\\.3 percent, a 260 basis points improvement over the prior year.\\n\\n**Outlook**Regarding the Company\\'s outlook, Mr. Hill said, \"Our operating performance in the first quarter was solid and in line with our expectations.\\xa0 We remain on track to deliver $2\\\\.15 to $2\\\\.30 billion of Adjusted EBITDA, marking the fourth consecutive year of double\\\\-digit growth.\\xa0 The pricing environment remains positive, and our focus remains on compounding unit margins through all parts of the cycle, creating value for our shareholders through improving returns on capital.\"\\n\\nAll aspects of the Company\\'s outlook in February remain unchanged.\\n\\n**Conference Call**Vulcan will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. CT on May 2, 2024\\\\.\\xa0 A webcast will be available via the Company\\'s

About Vulcan\\n\\nOur business is built on essentials. What we mine and sell—aggregates—are indispensable to infrastructure and growth. How we run our company also comes down to essentials. We run our business with great discipline and integrity. We maintain a great place to work and grow. We take care of the land through the entire cycle of productive use from mining to restoration and re\\\\-use. We serve our customers and communities well. Always with the long view in mind. This is how we sustain success.\\n\\nWe are Vulcan. And we deliver value.\\n\\n![About Vulcan](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/about-vulcan/aboutlanding_body.png?sfvrsn=c96e2a2f_1)\\n\\nVulcan Materials Company is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates—primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel—and a major producer of aggregates\\\\-based construction materials including asphalt and ready\\\\-mixed concrete. Our coast\\\\-to\\\\-coast footprint and strategic distribution network align with and serve the nation’s growth centers. We are headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama.\\n\\nVulcan has over\\xa0404\\\\*\\xa0active aggregates facilities, and\\xa071\\\\*\\xa0asphalt facilities and\\xa0142\\\\*\\xa0concrete facilities, which also consume aggregates.\\xa0Most\\xa0are located in the U.S. except for our quarries and marine terminals on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada,\\xa0Honduras\\xa0and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.\\n\\nWhat we produce is used in nearly all forms of construction. In particular, large quantities of aggregates are used to build and repair valuable infrastructure such as roads, bridges, waterworks and ports, and to construct buildings both residential and nonresidential, such as manufacturing facilities, office buildings, schools, hospitals and churches.\\n\\n\\xa0\\\\* Data from 2022 10k and Annual Report\\n\\n[Meet Vulcan\\'s Leadership](https://ir.vulcanmaterials.com/governance/executive-management/default.aspx)\\n\\n[Vulcan Corporate Office](/about-vulcan/corporate-office)\\n\\n[Vulcan History](/about-vulcan/history)\\n\\n[Industry Links](/about-vulcan/industry-links)\\n\\n### [Contact](/contact)\\n\\n**Vulcan Materials Company**\\nCorporate Office\\n1200 Urban Center Drive\\nBirmingham, AL 35242\\nTel: (205\\\\) 298\\\\-3000\\n\\nPlease follow the hyperlinks to review the [Business Conduct Policy](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files.vulcanmaterials.com/vmc/Business-Conduct-Policy.pdf) or to report [concerns](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/16082/index.html).\\n\\nSiga los hipervínculos para revisar la\\xa0[Política de Conducta Empresarial](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files.vulcanmaterials.com/vmc/VMC-Business_Conduct_Policy_Spanish-2021.pdf)\\xa0o para reportar algún\\xa0[problema](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/es/gui/16082/index.html).\\n\\nContact us for\\xa0[Product Sales](/construction-materials/product-sales).\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/footer_aboutvulcan.png?sfvrsn=a4a41105_1)\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/footer_constructionmaterials.png?sfvrsn=c59fead5_1)\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/footer_investorrelations.png?sfvrsn=3d684e71_1)\\n\\n![](https://vulcanmaterials.azureedge.net/content-v2/images/default-source/default-album/social-responsibility-footer.jpg?sfvrsn=c6651106_1)\\n\\nAbout Vulcan\\n\\n* [History](/about-vulcan/history)\\n* [Mission and Values](/about-vulcan/mission-and-values)\\n* [Executive Management](/about-vulcan/executive-management)\\n* [Corporate Office](/about-vulcan/corporate-office)\\n* [Industry Links](/about-vulcan/industry-links)\\n* [Careers](/about-vulcan/careers)\\n\\nConstruction Materials\\n\\n* [MyVulcan](/construction-materials/myvulcan)\\n* [Product Sales](/construction-materials/product-sales)\\n* [Products and Services](/construction-materials/products-and-services)\\n* [Suppliers](/construction-materials/suppliers)\\n* [Facilities Map](/construction-materials/facilities-map)\\n* [Operating Groups](/construction-materials/operating-groups)\\n* [Product Calculators](/construction-materials/product-calculators)\\n* [Credit Applications](/construction-materials/credit-applications)\\n* [Safety Data Sheets](/construction-materials/safety-data-sheets)\\n* [Product Declaration](/construction-materials/product-declaration)\\n* [Facilities](/construction-materials/facilities)\\n\\nInvestor Relations\\n\\n* [Overview](/investor-relations/overview)\\n* [Why Invest](/investor-relations/why-invest)\\n* [News](/investor-relations/news)\\n* [Events \\\\& Presentations](/investor-relations/events-presentations)\\n* [Stock Info](/investor-relations/stock-info)\\n* [Financials](/investor-relations/financials)\\n* [Governance](/investor-relations/governance)\\n* [Link to Earnings Call](/investor-relations/link-to-earnings-call)\\n* [Link to 2022 Investor Day](/investor-relations/link-to-2022-investor-day)\\n\\nSocial Responsibility\\n\\n* [2023 Sustainability Report](/social-responsibility/2023-sustainability-report)\\n* [Safety \\\\& Health](/social-responsibility/safety-health)\\n* [Environmental Stewardship](/social-responsibility/environmental-stewardship)\\n* [People](/social-responsibility/people)\\n* [Community](/social-responsibility/community)\\n* [Governance](/social-responsibility/governance)\\n* [Teacher Center](/social-responsibility/teacher-center)\\n* [Vulcan Foundation](/social-responsibility/vulcan-foundation)\\n\\n* [Site Map](/site-map)\\n* [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use)\\n* [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\\n* [California Residents\\' Privacy Notice](/california-privacy-notice)\\n* [Contact Us About Our Site](/contact)\\n© 2024 Vulcan Materials Company', 1, 1)</details></pre></div><div class='basic-prompt-box' style='background-color:#ffffba; padding: 4px;'>\n",

solid execution helped us overcome challenging weather conditions throughout much of the first quarter.\\xa0 Margins expanded despite lower aggregates shipments, demonstrating the durability of our aggregates business and its attractive compounding growth characteristics.\\xa0 Aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased 10 percent in the first quarter, with improvements widespread across our footprint.\\xa0 A consistent focus on our strategic disciplines coupled with continued pricing momentum reinforces our confidence in our full year outlook and our ability to deliver another year of double\\\\-digit earnings growth and strong cash generation.\"\\n\\n**First Quarter Segment Results**\\n\\n**Aggregates**Segment gross profit was $303 million ($6\\\\.30 per ton).\\xa0 Cash gross profit per ton improved 10 percent to $8\\\\.86 per ton, despite lower shipments due to unfavorable weather conditions throughout most of the quarter.\\xa0 Improvements in unit profitability were widespread across the Company\\'s footprint and resulted from continued pricing momentum and solid operational execution.\\n\\nPrice increases effective at the beginning of the year resulted in another quarter of attractive growth.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted selling prices increased 10 percent versus the prior year, with all markets realizing year\\\\-over\\\\-year improvement.\\xa0 Freight\\\\-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 10 percent, primarily driven by a 7 percent decline in aggregates shipments due to unfavorable weather.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, unit cash cost increased 9 percent, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of unit cost deceleration.\\n\\n**Asphalt and Concrete**Asphalt segment gross profit was $5 million, and cash gross profit was $14 million, a 39 percent improvement over the prior year.\\xa0 Shipments increased 3 percent, and price improved 6 percent.\\xa0 Strong shipments in Arizona and California, the Company\\'s largest asphalt markets, were partially offset by lower shipments in Texas due to weather impacts.\\xa0 Concrete segment gross profit was a loss of $3 million. \\xa0Cash gross profit was $9 million, and unit cash gross profit improved 10 percent despite lower volumes.\\xa0 The prior year included results from the previously divested concrete assets in Texas.\\n\\n**Selling, Administrative and General (SAG)**SAG expense of $130 million was in line with the Company\\'s expectations for the first quarter.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, SAG expense was $555 million, or 7\\\\.2 percent of total revenues.\\n\\n**Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation**Capital expenditures were $103 million in the first quarter.\\xa0 For the full year, the Company expects to spend $625 to $675 million for maintenance and growth projects. \\xa0During the quarter, the Company returned $81 million to shareholders through $19 million of common stock repurchases and $62 million of dividends.\\xa0 The Company also used $550 million of cash on hand to redeem its 2026 notes, resulting in a ratio of total debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 1\\\\.7 times, or 1\\\\.5 times on a net basis reflecting $300 million of cash on hand.\\xa0 A strong liquidity and balance sheet profile positions the Company well for continued growth.\\xa0 The Company\\'s weighted\\\\-average debt maturity was 11 years, and the effective weighted\\\\-average interest rate was 4\\\\.8 percent.\\xa0 On a trailing\\\\-twelve months basis, return on average invested capital was 16\\\\.3 percent, a 260 basis points improvement over the prior year.\\n\\n**Outlook**Regarding the Company\\'s outlook, Mr. Hill said, \"Our operating performance in the first quarter was solid and in line with our expectations.\\xa0 We remain on track to deliver $2\\\\.15 to $2\\\\.30 billion of Adjusted EBITDA, marking the fourth consecutive year of double\\\\-digit growth.\\xa0 The pricing environment remains positive, and our focus remains on compounding unit margins through all parts of the cycle, creating value for our shareholders through improving returns on capital.\"\\n\\nAll aspects of the Company\\'s outlook in February remain unchanged.\\n\\n**Conference Call**Vulcan will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. CT on May 2, 2024\\\\.\\xa0 A webcast will be available via the Company\\'s
