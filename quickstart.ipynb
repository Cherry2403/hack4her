       "'Donald Trump is the 45th President of the United States, serving from 2017 to 2021. He is a businessman, real estate developer, and television personality who was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York.\\n\\nBefore entering politics, Trump made a name for himself in the business world, building a real estate empire and creating a brand that became synonymous with luxury and success. He developed numerous high-end properties, including hotels, casinos, and golf courses, and wrote several bestselling books on business and entrepreneurship.\\n\\nTrump\\'s rise to fame also included a successful reality TV show, \"The Apprentice,\" which aired from 2004 to 2015 and featured him as the host and executive producer. He became known for his charismatic personality, his catchphrase \"You\\'re fired!,\" and his ability to build a brand and create a sense of excitement around his business ventures.\\n\\nIn 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, running on a platform of populist and nationalist policies. He campaigned on issues such as immigration reform, trade protectionism, and a promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Despite being a political outsider and facing significant opposition from the Republican establishment, Trump won the nomination and went on to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the general election on November 8, 2016.\\n\\nAs President, Trump\\'s administration was marked by controversy, polarization, and a series of high-profile scandals. Some of his notable policies and actions included:\\n\\n* The travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries\\n* The withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement\\n* The imposition of tariffs on imported goods from countries such as China and Mexico\\n* The attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)\\n* The appointment of two Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh\\n\\nTrump\\'s presidency was also marked by a series of investigations and controversies, including:\\n\\n* The Russia investigation, which examined allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials\\n* The impeachment inquiry, which centered on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress\\n* The Stormy Daniels scandal, which involved allegations of a non-disclosure agreement and hush money payments to a adult film star\\n\\nTrump lost his re-election bid to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, and his term as President ended on January 20, 2021. Despite his departure from office, Trump remains a prominent figure in American politics and continues to be a subject of controversy and debate.'"
