Match chisel set (could apply to camping or woodworking, but Harry is already fulfilled -> Jun, so Raku guide is for Fred)\n7. Match custom dice (could apply to board games or tabletop RPGs -> Lucy or Sara)\n8. Match “War and Peace” American film copy (could apply to old movies or Audrey Hepburn -> Perry or Alex)\n9. Match yarn (only applies to knitting -> Micah, so the Galileo biography is for Miguel)\n10. Match \"One Piece\" graphic novel (could apply to books or manga, but Micah already has yarn -> Alex, so the \"War and Peace\" film is for Perry)\n11. Match \"War and Peace\" novel (could apply to books or historical fiction novels, but Micah has yarn -> Tyson)\n12. Match Starbucks gift card (only applies to coffee -> Lucy, so the dice are for Sara)\n13. Match foam exercise mat (only applies to yoga -> Georgette)\n14.
