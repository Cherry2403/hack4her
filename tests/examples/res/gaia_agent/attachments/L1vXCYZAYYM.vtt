00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
But one challenge stops them in their tracks.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
A giant petrel.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
They try to flee, but running isn't an emperor's strong point.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
A slip is all the petrel needs.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
The chick is grabbed by his neck feathers.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
But the down just falls away.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
They form a defensive circle and prepare to stand their ground.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Despite their chick-like appearance, they are close to a metre tall.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Quite a size, even for a giant petrel.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
The chick towers to full height, protecting those behind.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
His defiance buys time.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
It's a standoff.

01:14.000 --> 01:26.000
Then, as if from nowhere, an Adeli, the feistiest penguin in the world.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
He fearlessly puts himself between the chicks and the petrel.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Even petrels don't mess with the delis.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Their plucky rescuer accompanies the chicks to the sea.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
The fair.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
The fair.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
The fair.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
The fair.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
The fair.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
The fair.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
The fair.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
The fair...

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
The fair.
