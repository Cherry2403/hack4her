I got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker on my phone is buzzing so I can't quite make out what she's saying. Could you please listen to the recipe and list all of the ingredients that my friend described? I only want the ingredients for the filling, as I have everything I need to make my favorite pie crust. I've attached the recipe as Strawberry pie.mp3.\n\nIn your response, please only list the ingredients, not any measurements. So if the recipe calls for \"a pinch of salt\" or \"two cups of ripe strawberries\" the ingredients on the list would be \"salt\" and \"ripe strawberries\".\n\nPlease format your response as a comma separated list of ingredients. Also, please alphabetize the ingredients.\nMP3 document content:\n### Audio Transcript:\nIn a saucepan, combine ripe strawberries, granulated sugar, freshly squeezed lemon juice and cornstarch. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens to a smooth consistency. Remove from heat and stir in a dash of pure vanilla extract. Allow the strawberry pie feeling to cool before using it as a delicious and fruity feeling for your pie crust.",
