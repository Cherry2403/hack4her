The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?",

The box it is placed in is chosen uniformly at random.\n\nYou can choose an index $i$ and the first $i$ boxes will be opened. The cost of doing this is an increasing positive function $f(x)$ . You must do this with different values $i$ until you find the coin. Clearly if $i\\=n$ then you find the coin immediately.\n\nTo clarify, if you choose $3$ you get to open boxes 1, 2 and 3 and it costs you $f(3\\)$. Having chosen 3, you must pay $f(3\\)$ regardless of whether boxes 1,2 have been checked already.\n\nHow can you find an optimal strategy to play this game with minimum expected cost?\n\n* [probability](/questions/tagged/probability \"show questions tagged 'probability'\")\n* [game\\-theory](/questions/tagged/game-theory \"show questions tagged 'game-theory'\")\n* [discrete\\-optimization](/questions/tagged/discrete-optimization \"show questions tagged 'discrete-optimization'\")\n\n[Share](/q/4951364 \"Short permalink to this question\")\n\nCite\n\n Follow\n\n[edited Jul 27 at 22:00](/posts/4951364/revisions \"show all edits to this post\")\n\nSimd\n\n asked Jul 27 at 20:25\n\n[![Simd's user avatar](https://i.sstatic.net/Rd3qU.png?s=64)](/users/1131135/simd)\n\n[Simd](/users/1131135/simd)Simd\n\n50111 silver badge1515 bronze badges\n\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n5\n\n* 2\n\n$\\\\begingroup$\nPlease edit to include your efforts.

Let value function $V(k)$ denote the minimum expected cost when you know that the coin is not among the first $k$ boxes. You want to compute $V(0\\)$. The boundary condition is $V(n\\-1\\)\\=f(n)$, and for $j \\< n\\-1$ conditioning on $i$ yields recurrence\n$$V(j)\\=\\\\min\\_{i\\=j\\+1}^n \\\\left(f(i) \\+ \\\\frac{n\\-i}{n\\-j}V(i)\\\\right).$$\nThat is, you pay $f(i)$ immediately, with probability $\\\\frac{i\\-j}{n\\-j}$ the coin is found among the $i\\-j$ newly opened boxes (ending the search), and with probability $\\\\frac{n\\-i}{n\\-j}$ the coin is among boxes $\\\\{i\\+1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}$.\n\n[Share](/a/4951368 \"Short permalink to this answer\")\n\nCite\n\n Follow\n\n[edited Jul 27 at 21:05](/posts/4951368/revisions \"show all edits to this post\")\n\n answered Jul 27 at 20:38\n\n[![RobPratt's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f36ba79baf6d832ea7f8c6ac519e284?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](/users/683666/robpratt)\n\n[RobPratt](/users/683666/robpratt)RobPratt\n\n48\\.7k33 gold badges2525 silver badges6363 bronze badges\n\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n2\n\n* $\\\\begingroup$\nThank you so much.\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n– [Simd](/users/1131135/simd \"501 reputation\")\n\nCommented\nJul 27 at 20:45\n* $\\\\begingroup$\n@Simd [**Please do *not* add a comment on your question or on an answer to say \"Thank you\"**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers)\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n– [no comment](/users/983589/no-comment \"370 reputation\")\n\nCommented\nJul 27 at 21:01\n\n[Add a comment](# \"Use comments to ask for more information or suggest improvements.

Assuming the relation between $i$ and $c(T(i))$ is linear, then the solution should be, $$c(T(i)) \\= \\\\min \\\\sum\\_{i \\\\in N}^{}c \\\\left ( i, T(i) \\\\right ) \\= \\\\sum\\_{n\\=i}^{}c \\\\left ( n, T(n) \\\\right )\\= c \\\\left ( n, T(n) \\\\right )$$\nmeaning in order to minimize the total cost, open all the boxes, since the coin can be found in one transport operation, and if $i\\<n$, then all other costs to open boxes not containing the coin in the set will inevitably be greater.\n\n[Share](/a/4951374 \"Short permalink to this answer\")\n\nCite\n\n Follow\n\n answered Jul 27 at 21:05\n\n[![Tayler Montgomery's user avatar](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJPCj6V07akKV3uEXpKIgLPLnbGOmwwBeRFA0YncXDTPl8=k-s64)](/users/1290423/tayler-montgomery)\n\n[Tayler Montgomery](/users/1290423/tayler-montgomery)Tayler Montgomery\n\n5155 bronze badges\n\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n1\n\n* 1\n\n$\\\\begingroup$\nConsider the case $n\\=2$ with cost $f(1\\)\\=1$ and $f(2\\)\\=1000000$.\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n– [RobPratt](/users/683666/robpratt \"48,726 reputation\")\n\nCommented\nJul 27 at 22:44\n\n[Add a comment](# \"Use comments to ask for more information or suggest improvements.
