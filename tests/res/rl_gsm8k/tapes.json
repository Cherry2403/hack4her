Since 80 pages is equivalent to 1 inch, and the stack is 12 inches thick, we multiply 80 pages/inch by 12 inches to get the total number of pages.\n   Total pages = 80 pages/inch * 12 inches = 960 pages\n\n2. Since Jack has 6 books, we need to divide the total number of pages by 6 to find the average number of pages per book.\n   Average pages per book = Total pages / 6\n   Average pages per book = 960 pages / 6\n   Average pages per book = 160 pages\n\nThe answer is: 160",
