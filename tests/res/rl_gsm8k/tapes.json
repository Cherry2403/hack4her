To find out how many sets of 5 kilograms are there in 20 kilograms, we divide 20 by 5:\n\n20 / 5 = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 sets of 5 kilograms.

Identify the initial membership fee.\n   The initial membership fee in the first year is $80.\n\n2. Determine the increase in the membership fee each year.\n   The membership fee increases by $10 each year.\n\n3. Calculate the total increase in the membership fee from the first year to the sixth year.\n   Since the fee increases by $10 each year, over 5 years (from the first to the sixth year), the total increase is:\n   $10/year * 5 years = $50\n\n4. Add the total increase to the initial membership fee to find the cost of the membership in the sixth year.\n   Initial fee + Total increase = $80 + $50 = $130\n\nThe answer is: $130",
