If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive? Think step by step. When you know the answer to the question, provide it in the following format: The answer is: <number><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find out how much money you would receive, we need to calculate the earnings from recycling cans and newspapers separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Calculate the earnings from recycling cans:\n   You received $0.50 for every 12 cans. To find out how many sets of 12 cans you have, divide the total number of cans by 12.\n   144 cans / 12 cans per set = 12 sets\n   Since you receive $0.50 for every 12 cans, multiply the number of sets by $0.50.\n   12 sets * $0.50/set = $6\n\n2. Calculate the earnings from recycling newspapers:\n   You received $1.50 for every 5 kilograms of newspapers. To find out how many sets of 5 kilograms you have, divide the total number of kilograms by 5.\n   20 kilograms / 5 kilograms per set = 4 sets\n   Since you receive $1.50 for every 5 kilograms, multiply the number of sets by $1.50.\n   4 sets * $1.50/set = $6\n\n3. Add the earnings from recycling cans and newspapers together:\n   $6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12\n\nThe answer is: $12<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":992,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.020589547231793404,-0.0999675765633583,-0.6931471824645996,-0.1106809750199318,0.0,-0.00009703165414975956,-0.006868324708193541,-0.2380744069814682,0.0,-0.003685707226395607,-0.8891499042510986,-0.009946544654667377,0.0,-0.023915275931358337,-0.008165547624230385,-2.1678290367126465,-0.001620528637431562,-0.19768743216991425,-0.0789763331413269,-2.145764938177308e-6,-0.0026326067745685577,-0.00005280832192511298,-1.1685519218444824,-0.00007676783570786938,-0.0022961937356740236,-0.0006194579764269292,-0.0033096084371209145,-0.0019151695305481553,-0.3230228126049042,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.0729377418756485,-0.5302852392196655,-0.006720914505422115,-2.145764938177308e-6,-0.005149316042661667,-0.00003218599158572033,-0.014607624150812626,-0.08411228656768799,-0.44326359033584595,-2.013944387435913,-0.0007839705212973058,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.00010978573118336499,-0.00027807659353129566,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.1281684786081314,-1.3084733486175537,-0.00007724463648628443,-0.05573277920484543,-0.032964207231998444,-0.006678048521280289,-0.04186374321579933,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00027021096320822835,-0.18407799303531647,-0.05824107676744461,-0.006832095794379711,-0.059697557240724564,-0.027618875727057457,-0.0000641325386823155,-0.01940727047622204,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.4613690972328186,0.0,0.0,-0.3533240854740143,-0.000022053474822314456,-0.042454153299331665,0.0,-0.0034104774240404367,-0.0019177870126441121,0.0,0.0,-0.13099636137485504,-0.15580132603645325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.06693069636821747,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.976535975933075,-0.026258064433932304,-0.9959982633590698,-0.00004827859811484814,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.2942426800727844,-0.6938107013702393,-2.097463607788086,-5.960446742392378e-6,-0.000016569954823353328,-0.012803846038877964,-0.15955215692520142,-0.0021671399008482695,-0.0001429217227268964,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00019107422849629074,-0.407499760389328,0.0,0.0,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.2961692214012146,0.0,-0.00007188061863416806,0.0,-2.7418097943154862e-6,-0.0011742371134459972,-1.0728830375228426e-6,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-1.633163332939148,-5.960462772236497e-7,-5.960462772236497e-7,0.0,-0.07907514274120331,-0.00022432672267314047,0.0,-1.1920922133867862e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.008128301240503788,-0.000011205610462639015,-8.344646857949556e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.00013541258522309363,-0.005588147323578596,0.0,0.0,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-2.145764938177308e-6,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-9.536738616588991e-7,-0.0032721806783229113,-0.00005376194530981593,-5.125986263010418e-6,-0.0008904544520191848,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000011444026313256472,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000013947389561508317,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.00023398046323563904,-0.005824379622936249,-4.768370445162873e-7,-1.6689286894688848e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-1.0720266103744507,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000015139465176616795,-0.0066968766041100025,0.0,0.0,-0.00001156323378381785,0.0,-0.00046993177966214716,-0.000010251946150674485,-0.0022903657518327236,-6.556489552167477e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.0005541696446016431,-0.000020861407392658293,0.0,-2.9802276912960224e-6,0.0,0.0,-7.152555099310121e-7,-0.00007009260298218578,0.0,-3.4570634852570947e-6,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.6954811548639555e-6,0.0,-0.00032074074260890484,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.0025704221334308386,-9.536738616588991e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-8.34461570775602e-6,0.0,-9.775113539944869e-6,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.2186455882765586e-6,-1.1920922133867862e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.00028689560713246465,-0.006690482143312693,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.041500017046928406,-0.0002787916746456176,-0.00013720047718379647,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-0.1654834747314453,-0.000012874520507466514,0.0,-2.3841830625315197e-6,-0.24686899781227112,-0.34118637442588806,-0.000028609820219571702,-0.016009241342544556,0.0,-0.0006080209277570248,-1.504398226737976,-0.008065629750490189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.4570634852570947e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0001358893496217206,-0.00045622908510267735,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.00391182117164135,-0.0006622266955673695,0.0,-0.00010978573118336499],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"9ea7706c-b6dd-452c-94e4-df409234c68d"}

sets of 12 cans you have, divide 144 by 12:\n\n144 รท 12 = 12\n\nSo, you have 12 sets of 12 cans. \n\nMultiply the number of sets by the reward per set:\n\n12 sets * $0.50 per set = $6\n\nNow, let's calculate the money received from recycling newspapers:\n\nYou have 20 kilograms of newspapers, and for every 5 kilograms, you receive $1.50. \n\nTo find out how many sets of 5 kilograms you have, divide 20 by 5:\n\n20 รท 5 = 4\n\nSo, you have 4 sets of 5 kilograms. \n\nMultiply the number of sets by the reward per set:\n\n4 sets * $1.50 per set = $6\n\nNow, add the money received from

Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked? Think step by step. When you know the answer to the question, provide it in the following format: The answer is: <number><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find out how much money they made from the strawberries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many strawberries Matthew picked: Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, and Betty picked 16 strawberries. So, Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.\n\n2. Find out how many strawberries Natalie picked: Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. So, Natalie picked 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of strawberries they picked: Betty picked 16 strawberries, Matthew picked 36, and Natalie picked 18. So, in total they picked 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.\n\n4. Determine how many jars of jam they made: Each jar of jam uses 7 strawberries. They picked 70 strawberries in total. So, they can make 70 / 7 = 10 jars of jam.\n\n5. Calculate how much money they made from the jam: They sold each jar of jam for $4. They made 10 jars of jam. So, they made 10 * 4 = $40 from the jam.\n\nThe answer is: $40<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":956,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.15521244704723358,-0.27357685565948486,-0.2942464053630829,-0.0011207734933122993,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-1.0728830375228426e-6,-0.15510985255241394,-0.9986492395401001,-0.29424169659614563,-0.006333991419523954,-6.437280717364047e-6,-0.04677288234233856,-0.5302891731262207,-0.03171413764357567,0.0,-0.6656996011734009,-0.05706670507788658,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.000399033073335886,-0.0016038662288337946,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.7628798484802246,-0.0023225971963256598,-3.6954811548639555e-6,0.0,-2.264974000354414e-6,-0.17287348210811615,-0.9969762563705444,-1.8124399185180664,-1.155877947807312,-1.1920922133867862e-6,-0.000022291887944447808,-0.00002634490556374658,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.0011236312566325068,0.0,0.0,-0.5003133416175842,-0.0714612528681755,-0.09359949082136154,-5.245195097813848e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.2944801449775696,-0.010196971707046032,-0.13665568828582764,-0.11069133132696152,-0.00003814624506048858,-6.198863957251888e-6,-0.00006687417771900073,-0.003911464940756559,-0.00005364274329622276,0.0,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.7881377516459906e-6,-0.0033362226095050573,-0.0003502947511151433,0.0,-0.008334261365234852,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,-1.9073468138230965e-6,-0.043322909623384476,-3.099436753473128e-6,-5.960446742392378e-6,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.11070872098207474,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,-0.21452420949935913,-0.2602481245994568,-0.00006425174069590867,-0.0007204797584563494,-4.529942543740617e-6,-0.002284181071445346,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-0.002687059575691819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00013255194062367082,-1.4305104514278355e-6,0.0,-1.6503100395202637,-0.00010048838157672435,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0007883778307586908,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.4198201596736908,-0.0032959445379674435,-0.003103442257270217,-0.02354123815894127,-0.002230776706710458,0.0,0.0,-0.7866144180297852,-0.0012341272085905075,-0.00008153582894010469,-0.000031470757676288486,0.0,0.0,-2.747838020324707,-0.00018761781393550336,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.004831662867218256,-0.209543839097023,-0.000834117061458528,-3.269717216491699,0.0,-3.4295854568481445,-0.00003814624506048858,-0.00014256415306590497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-1.0728830375228426e-6,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-9.536738616588991e-7,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-1.9732413291931152,-0.21452142298221588,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-9.298280929215252e-6,-0.003911464940756559,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.000028013790142722428,-0.3191056549549103,-0.0002506657037883997,-1.5274837017059326,-7.510157047363464e-6,-0.04778587073087692,0.0,-0.45213228464126587,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.21505053341388702,-2.4087188243865967,-0.6249856352806091,-0.21452391147613525,0.0,-2.50339189733495e-6,-0.3963894844055176,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.1547965109348297,-0.05674620345234871,-4.291525328881107e-6,-0.25598713755607605,-1.1214793920516968,-4.529942543740617e-6,-0.00009107174992095679,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00004017272294731811,0.0,0.0,-0.0001597276859683916,0.0,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.00003135155202471651,0.0,-0.000350175570929423,0.0,0.0,-0.023183133453130722,-0.8958427309989929,-1.311301275563892e-6,-0.00013124081306159496,0.0,-0.00023457636416424066,-0.7867227792739868,-0.694302499294281,-0.2182595133781433,-0.000019907753085135482,-0.2942446172237396,-0.015991879627108574,-0.000012874520507466514,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-0.4112726151943207,0.0,-1.3668696880340576,-3.6954811548639555e-6,0.0,-0.9304790496826172,-0.03427112102508545,-0.0027702786028385162,-0.00045908879837952554,0.0,0.0,-0.05947697535157204,0.0,-0.012268907390534878,-0.000064490144723095,0.0,-0.06749802827835083,-0.0019359909929335117,-0.014378511346876621,-0.0055879103019833565,-0.8880537748336792,-0.15473054349422455,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-2.50339189733495e-6,-0.016247248277068138,0.0,-1.238121747970581,-0.06710037589073181,-0.9972209930419922,-0.03910719230771065,-0.000763244170229882,-1.0728830375228426e-6,0.0,-0.0013400870375335217,-0.02315983735024929,0.0,-0.09338007867336273],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"d82da99d-aafc-4dab-89d1-4286eb06a166"}

Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked? Think step by step. When you know the answer to the question, provide it in the following format: The answer is: <number><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find out how much money they were able to make, let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Betty picked 16 strawberries.\n2. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, so Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.\n3. Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie. To find out how many strawberries Natalie picked, we divide Matthew's amount by 2. So, Natalie picked 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries.\n4. The total number of strawberries they picked is 16 (Betty) + 36 (Matthew) + 18 (Natalie) = 70 strawberries.\n5. One jar of jam uses 7 strawberries. To find out how many jars of jam they can make, we divide the total number of strawberries by 7. So, 70 / 7 = 10 jars.\n6. Each jar is sold at $4. To find out how much money they made, we multiply the number of jars by the price per jar. So, 10 jars * $4/jar = $40.\n\nThe answer is: $40<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":851,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.15521244704723358,-0.27357685565948486,-0.2942464053630829,-0.0011207734933122993,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-1.0728830375228426e-6,-0.15510985255241394,-0.4623371362686157,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.1132903099060059,-0.5302861928939819,0.0,-0.03037496656179428,-0.3984374701976776,-7.867782187531702e-6,-1.3763155937194824,-3.4299745559692383,-0.03304448351264,-1.1136023998260498,-0.07867997139692307,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.9303000569343567,-0.000011086402082582936,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.6825302839279175,-0.002185577293857932,0.0,-0.00005209310256759636,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-4.529942543740617e-6,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00009262132516596466,0.0,0.0,-0.5335216522216797,-0.06646165251731873,-0.23541846871376038,-0.00018761781393550336,-0.005276443902403116,-0.00007688703772146255,-0.00018761781393550336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.1920922133867862e-6,-0.00039402826223522425,-0.0009420248097740114,0.0,-0.022456632927060127,-0.04679279029369354,-7.510157047363464e-6,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.13100922107696533,-4.768370445162873e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-3.952357530593872,-0.6923811435699463,0.0,-0.013788566924631596,-2.861018856492592e-6,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.18245042860507965,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000015139465176616795,-0.0469822958111763,-0.8308117389678955,-0.2145698070526123,0.0,-2.5170938968658447,-0.00010168035078095272,-0.00001537788011773955,0.0,-1.3817800283432007,-1.1584010124206543,-0.21456970274448395,-0.002300356514751911,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.00007676783570786938,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0007057083421386778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0662245973944664,-7.271740287251305e-6,0.0,-1.1186715364456177,-0.000029801878554280847,-0.0016094601014629006,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.19402721524238586,-0.00034195298212580383,-0.02358163893222809,-0.9069130420684814,-2.50339189733495e-6,-0.1547299325466156,-0.0016399280866608024,0.0,-0.004675290081650019,0.0,0.0,-0.000010013530300057027,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-3.576278118089249e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-7.152555099310121e-7,0.0,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.0007950482540763915,-0.000476246903417632,0.0,0.0,-0.7204001545906067,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.04160111024975777,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.5305415391921997,-0.0004489606071729213,-0.0006716379430145025,-0.0002683041093405336,-0.00010978573118336499,-4.768370445162873e-7,-9.298280929215252e-6,-1.1132937669754028,0.0,-2.7418097943154862e-6,-0.03364726901054382,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0010068115079775453,-0.0034029928501695395,-0.00003433168603805825,-0.0002668739762157202,0.0,-0.001434250851161778,0.0,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.0013854438439011574,-0.0022896521259099245,0.0,-0.04679085314273834,-0.18404021859169006,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.29438459873199463,0.0,-0.014156044460833073,0.0,0.0,-0.0002060916303889826,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,-0.0008027906878851354,-2.7477989196777344,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-2.2595114707946777,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-3.0872011184692383,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.21452218294143677,-8.344646857949556e-7,0.0,-0.09338072687387466,-0.005451218690723181,-2.622600959512056e-6,-0.0392596460878849,-0.15669290721416473,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.002290128031745553,0.0,-0.16119475662708282,-0.02484295703470707,-0.00005471556869451888,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00013136000779923052,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.003732383018359542,-0.00002658331868587993,-0.005640780087560415,-0.21996726095676422,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.01950395666062832,-0.05644429847598076,0.0,-0.000038980677345534787,0.0,-0.20176491141319275,-0.01971459947526455,-0.0011206544004380703,0.0,-0.5773770213127136,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-8.344646857949556e-7,0.0,-0.0002908283786382526,-0.000028371408916427754,0.0,0.0,-0.002737348433583975,-0.0007908792467787862,0.0,-0.1106809750199318],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"d82da99d-aafc-4dab-89d1-4286eb06a166"}

To find the average number of pages in each book, we divide the total number of pages by 6:\n\n960 pages / 6 books = 160 pages per book\n\nThe answer is: 160<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":460,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.008093773387372494,-0.02370656281709671,-1.644689679145813,-0.8878122568130493,-0.29272034764289856,-0.00013374387344811112,0.0,0.0,-1.3862810134887695,-5.722029527532868e-6,-0.00005364274329622276,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.010502898134291172,-0.12315230071544647,0.0,-3.1318273544311523,-0.37636858224868774,-0.5302708148956299,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-9.059865078597795e-6,0.0,-0.000023841574147809297,-0.00454440712928772,-0.09390102326869965,-0.006072049494832754,-0.5998725295066833,-2.097560405731201,-0.07868415862321854,-0.002833995968103409,-0.10553146153688431,-0.45119842886924744,-0.09364910423755646,-0.25757890939712524,-0.03812460973858833,-0.009537606500089169,0.0,-0.0027056061662733555,-0.13729403913021088,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00022456508304458112,-0.0009137984015978873,-0.7541006207466125,-0.4618457555770874,-0.2954734265804291,-0.6077914834022522,-0.6969390511512756,-0.03925918787717819,0.0,-0.02128939889371395,-0.39820703864097595,-0.0001998939987970516,-0.000021934269170742482,-0.0013423488708212972,0.0,0.0,-4.198789596557617,-0.0027998790610581636,-0.18246890604496002,-0.00910511240363121,-1.4305104514278355e-6,-0.0007653883076272905,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00001847726889536716,-4.529942543740617e-6,0.0,-7.152555099310121e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.0013749678619205952,-0.4022231698036194,-0.45171689987182617,-0.040642838925123215,-0.20002254843711853,-1.3494426012039185,0.0,-0.00002407998726994265,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.21382781863212585,-0.011896848678588867,-0.00015960850578267127,-0.29424169659614563,-0.0004925706889480352,-0.00004434487345861271,0.0,0.0,-0.11077968776226044,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.00009178694017464295,-1.311301275563892e-6,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.03977622091770172,-7.510157047363464e-6,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.01625194028019905,-2.255929708480835,0.0,-0.0013634203933179379,-0.00002288792165927589,-0.000011086402082582936,-0.0055900439620018005,0.0,0.0,-0.019396396353840828,-5.245195097813848e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.39951470494270325,0.0,-0.0022161465603858232,-0.04024512320756912,-0.00009178694017464295,0.0,-0.019396279007196426,-1.6689286894688848e-6,-0.0000107287787614041,-0.0007730118231847882],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"e83978b3-3f7c-4aec-9e94-94d7756507af"}
