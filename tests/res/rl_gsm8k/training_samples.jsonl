If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive? Think step by step. When you know the answer to the question, provide it in the following format: The answer is: <number><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find out how much money you would receive, we need to calculate the earnings from recycling cans and newspapers separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Calculate the earnings from recycling cans:\n   You received $0.50 for every 12 cans. To find out how many sets of 12 cans you have, divide the total number of cans by 12.\n   144 cans / 12 cans per set = 12 sets\n   Since you receive $0.50 for every 12 cans, multiply the number of sets by $0.50.\n   12 sets * $0.50/set = $6\n\n2. Calculate the earnings from recycling newspapers:\n   You received $1.50 for every 5 kilograms of newspapers. To find out how many sets of 5 kilograms you have, divide the total number of kilograms by 5.\n   20 kilograms / 5 kilograms per set = 4 sets\n   Since you receive $1.50 for every 5 kilograms, multiply the number of sets by $1.50.\n   4 sets * $1.50/set = $6\n\n3. Add the earnings from recycling cans and newspapers together:\n   $6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12\n\nThe answer is: $12<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":992,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.020589547231793404,-0.0999675765633583,-0.6931471824645996,-0.1106809750199318,0.0,-0.00009703165414975956,-0.006868324708193541,-0.2380744069814682,0.0,-0.003685707226395607,-0.8891499042510986,-0.009946544654667377,0.0,-0.023915275931358337,-0.008238262496888638,-2.0693373680114746,-0.0019307559123262763,-0.1950078010559082,-0.11109335720539093,-1.7881377516459906e-6,-0.0020191536750644445,-0.0000895221673999913,-0.9565836787223816,-0.00005364274329622276,-0.001606484642252326,-0.00043418517452664673,-0.0033096084371209145,-0.0019151695305481553,-0.3392488360404968,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.07814518362283707,-0.6077629327774048,-0.00562560698017478,-2.145764938177308e-6,-0.005147655960172415,-0.0000385038583772257,-0.01023862510919571,-0.0841103196144104,-0.48014503717422485,-2.0139400959014893,-0.0007839705212973058,0.0,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.00010978573118336499,-0.0002885640424210578,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.12746602296829224,-1.441913366317749,-0.00007724463648628443,-0.055722858756780624,-0.04680541530251503,-0.007980012334883213,-0.041420187801122665,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0002641328901518136,-0.18407799303531647,-0.05798867344856262,-0.006827004719525576,-0.07097744941711426,-0.027618875727057457,-0.0000641325386823155,-0.016256045550107956,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.5310618281364441,0.0,0.0,-0.3533240854740143,-0.000022053474822314456,-0.04994623363018036,0.0,-0.004076623823493719,-0.0022922686766833067,0.0,0.0,-0.13099625706672668,-0.13190019130706787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.07050474733114243,-4.768370445162873e-7,-1.0284452438354492,-0.03127403184771538,-0.9705996513366699,-0.000039457496313843876,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.34293365478515625,-0.6938107013702393,-1.9424421787261963,-5.006777428206988e-6,-0.000016689160474925302,-0.012273970991373062,-0.13972283899784088,-0.003053528256714344,-0.00012694983161054552,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00016068121476564556,-0.47095751762390137,0.0,0.0,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.29585614800453186,0.0,-0.00006007967749610543,0.0,-2.7418097943154862e-6,-0.000982159748673439,-1.0728830375228426e-6,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-1.6331266164779663,-4.768370445162873e-7,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,-0.09384089708328247,-0.00022432672267314047,0.0,-1.1920922133867862e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.008130311034619808,-0.000017165990357170813,-8.344646857949556e-7,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.0001616347290109843,-0.005588147323578596,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-2.145764938177308e-6,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-9.536738616588991e-7,-0.0022896521259099245,-0.000053881147323409095,-6.079655122448457e-6,-0.0009432157967239618,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000011444026313256472,-4.410734163684538e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000011444026313256472,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.00023409964342135936,-0.006878032814711332,-4.768370445162873e-7,-1.9073468138230965e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-2.145764938177308e-6,-1.192449688911438,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000015139465176616795,-0.007998934015631676,0.0,0.0,-0.000013470558769768104,0.0,-0.000474936212413013,-0.000011920858014491387,-0.0022904847282916307,-7.510157047363464e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.00046433156239800155,-0.000020861407392658293,0.0,-2.50339189733495e-6,0.0,0.0,-9.536738616588991e-7,-0.0000594836674281396,0.0,-3.2186455882765586e-6,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-4.410734163684538e-6,0.0,-0.00032074074260890484,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920922133867862e-6,-0.0022574197500944138,-9.536738616588991e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-7.629365427419543e-6,0.0,-9.894321920000948e-6,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.099436753473128e-6,-1.311301275563892e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.00024291902082040906,-0.006690008565783501,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.041346874088048935,-0.0002348147245356813,-0.00013648532330989838,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-0.226625457406044,-0.0000107287787614041,0.0,-2.3841830625315197e-6,-0.24686899781227112,-0.31294551491737366,-0.0000290866428258596,-0.0147193418815732,0.0,-0.0005893162451684475,-1.504394769668579,-0.009636905044317245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-4.410734163684538e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0001209901092806831,-0.0004822045157197863,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.0032725371420383453,-0.0005539313424378633,0.0,-0.00013124081306159496],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"9936ad35-456b-4048-b8c9-797c08727937"}
