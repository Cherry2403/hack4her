If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive? Think step by step. When you know the answer to the question, provide it in the following format: The answer is: <number><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find the total amount of money received, we need to calculate the amount of money from recycling cans and from recycling newspapers separately, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of money from recycling cans:\n\nFor every 12 cans, you receive $0.50. To find out how many sets of 12 cans are there in 144 cans, we divide 144 by 12:\n\n144 / 12 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 sets of 12 cans. Multiply the number of sets by the amount of money received per set:\n\n12 sets * $0.50/set = $6\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of money from recycling newspapers:\n\nFor every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. To find out how many sets of 5 kilograms are there in 20 kilograms, we divide 20 by 5:\n\n20 / 5 = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 sets of 5 kilograms. Multiply the number of sets by the amount of money received per set:\n\n4 sets * $1.50/set = $6\n\nNow, add the amount of money from recycling cans and from recycling newspapers together:\n\n$6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12\n\nThe answer is: $12<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":1026,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.017443692311644554,-0.0999675765633583,-0.6931471824645996,-0.0011884062550961971,-0.03927454724907875,-0.0002416080387774855,0.0,-0.6108971834182739,-0.007181426044553518,-0.1115146353840828,-0.027252251282334328,0.0,-0.002082205144688487,-0.002362676663324237,-0.8820257782936096,-1.6127498149871826,0.0,-0.0812547504901886,-0.19781449437141418,-0.00954575464129448,-1.9073468138230965e-6,-2.1366021633148193,-0.07088661938905716,-8.34461570775602e-6,-0.03163491189479828,-0.4139198958873749,-0.5302721261978149,0.0,-0.0009411911014467478,-0.008130784146487713,-0.00035208225017413497,-0.0007838514284230769,-1.8085857629776,-0.0000107287787614041,-0.00895602349191904,0.0,-0.013841710053384304,-6.318072337307967e-6,-0.0557091049849987,-0.0007853999268263578,0.0,-0.03926308825612068,-0.00021586472576018423,-0.0000690197994117625,-0.32686537504196167,-0.9588484764099121,-0.0026865839026868343,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.0023224782198667526,-0.05625060573220253,-0.0002683041093405336,-1.4305104514278355e-6,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.06776954233646393,-2.444117784500122,-9.894321920000948e-6,-0.2946178913116455,-0.003272774862125516,-0.0055879103019833565,-0.037046756595373154,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00012182447244413197,-0.3476133942604065,-1.9424519538879395,-0.011390771716833115,-4.887569048150908e-6,0.0,-0.0013400870375335217,-0.007491944823414087,-0.019459765404462814,-0.07361497730016708,-0.016326766461133957,0.0,-0.00001847726889536716,0.0,0.0,-1.0212526321411133,-0.00026842328952625394,-0.9041635990142822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.05635438859462738,-1.136089563369751,-0.03927672654390335,-0.0332861952483654,-7.152555099310121e-7,0.0,0.0,-6.079655122448457e-6,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.00004494089080253616,0.0,0.0,-0.07994579523801804,-1.46343994140625,-0.04624078795313835,-0.00033444532891735435,0.0,-1.4305104514278355e-6,-0.004697952885180712,-0.0013399679446592927,-0.02925005555152893,-0.21683093905448914,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.11178150027990341,-0.15508463978767395,-0.00022492263815365732,-0.008664986118674278,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.5310697555541992,-0.0004899493651464581,-5.245195097813848e-6,0.0,0.0,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-0.38297927379608154,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.00003755022044060752,-7.152555099310121e-7,-0.11071555316448212,-0.2945396602153778,-0.0000107287787614041,-5.364403477869928e-6,0.0,-1.7881377516459906e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.9073468138230965e-6,-0.00006615896563744172,-0.0009396428358741105,-1.5497195136049413e-6,0.0,0.0,-1.7881377516459906e-6,-0.006678048521280289,-0.00001847726889536716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.4305104514278355e-6,-0.017733005806803703,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00026842328952625394,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.00002539125671319198,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.00016425691137555987,-0.0005183068569749594,-2.622600959512056e-6,0.0,0.0,-5.602820692729438e-6,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.00034898388548754156,-0.000012993727978027891,-9.536738616588991e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.000012755313036905136,-3.576278118089249e-7,-1.9073468138230965e-6,0.0,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.7881377516459906e-6,-0.0010249129263684154,0.0,-1.9073468138230965e-6,-1.311301275563892e-6,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,-5.960462772236497e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.0728830375228426e-6,-0.11069004982709885,-0.000012874520507466514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-4.410734163684538e-6,-8.344646857949556e-7,-8.344646857949556e-7,0.0,-5.960462772236497e-7,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-2.622600959512056e-6,-2.50339189733495e-6,0.0,0.0,-7.748573807475623e-6,-0.06796035170555115,-0.0012309125158935785,-0.8063210844993591,-0.0011210116790607572,-0.2623884379863739,-0.00022802136663813144,0.0,-0.027619339525699615,-0.009153071790933609,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.004293865989893675,-0.6985994577407837,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.41174817085266113,-0.027618875727057457,-0.00038521020906046033,0.0,-0.18241289258003235,-0.8881994485855103,-0.003980808891355991,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00002658331868587993,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.0001961992384167388,-0.0017636949196457863,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,-0.003272774862125516,-0.003921083174645901,0.0,-0.0006556744920089841],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"b24199ad-a70f-4e22-9d96-288804a1c208"}

To find out how many sets of 5 kilograms you have, divide the total weight of newspapers (20 kilograms) by 5:\n\n20 / 5 = 4\n\nSince you have 4 sets of 5 kilograms, you will receive 4 * $1.50 = $6 for recycling newspapers.\n\nNow, let's add the amount of money from recycling cans and newspapers together:\n\n$6 (cans) + $6 (newspapers) = $12\n\nThe answer is: $12<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":958,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.017443692311644554,-0.0999675765633583,-0.6931471824645996,-0.0011884062550961971,-0.03927454724907875,-0.0002416080387774855,0.0,-0.9684373140335083,-0.4562576711177826,0.0,-0.0004755319678224623,-0.5349905490875244,-0.014222684316337109,0.0,-0.007513241842389107,-0.00614527240395546,-0.5628838539123535,-1.1747076511383057,0.0,-0.0702979788184166,-0.22263148427009583,-0.02763441391289234,-1.9073468138230965e-6,-0.20032291114330292,-0.00003242440288886428,-0.4366593658924103,-0.5302720665931702,0.0,-0.0006596058374270797,-0.0010780243901535869,-0.0005666795768775046,-0.0009372609201818705,-1.3932664394378662,-8.940656698541716e-6,-0.0055564953945577145,0.0,-0.008371500298380852,-0.00001537788011773955,-0.07870244979858398,-0.0002683041093405336,0.0,-0.0028350658249109983,-0.0008229206432588398,-0.0000756950321374461,-0.32044604420661926,-0.39730188250541687,-0.5713428258895874,-0.000018358061424805783,0.0,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.0000641325386823155,-7.510157047363464e-6,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0409545861184597,-1.534723162651062,-0.000014424220353248529,-0.21552401781082153,-0.0009374991059303284,-0.0027372294571250677,-0.04888082668185234,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0001559135998832062,-0.13970263302326202,-0.019505826756358147,-0.005635682959109545,-0.6415903568267822,-0.019396279007196426,-0.00013124081306159496,-0.0013447299133986235,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.6935462355613708,0.0,-6.318072337307967e-6,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,-1.083564281463623,-0.000655793643090874,-1.625342607498169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.1552262157201767,-0.3173536956310272,-0.02292277291417122,-0.5770989060401917,-0.000034927710657939315,-8.821448318485636e-6,-0.0002706876548472792,-0.0004586121649481356,-0.00032085992279462516,0.0,-1.311301275563892e-6,-0.000950004265177995,-1.1778851747512817,-1.0706274509429932,-0.01300802268087864,-0.23973047733306885,-0.000940714729949832,-0.3219445049762726,-0.0003209791029803455,0.0,0.0,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-0.027374397963285446,-5.960462772236497e-7,0.0,-1.5155906677246094,-0.09429532289505005,-0.0559113547205925,-5.8412379075889476e-6,-0.1547311693429947,0.0,-0.000028967437174287625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.311301275563892e-6,-0.0069843437522649765,-4.0531076592742465e-6,-0.00006580135959666222,-0.00018821375851985067,-2.264974000354414e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-3.6954811548639555e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.0016023189527913928,-0.00001537788011773955,-0.000023841574147809297,-0.050414133816957474,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.00010978573118336499,-5.245195097813848e-6,-3.099436753473128e-6,-0.000017165990357170813,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00008546940807718784,-0.006815638393163681,0.0,-0.000025510462364763953,-5.602820692729438e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-0.5445353984832764,-0.0008431693422608078,-0.00014077626110520214,-0.00002396077979938127,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.020508499816060066,-1.7881377516459906e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.000012874520507466514,-2.0265558760002023e-6,-1.6689286894688848e-6,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-2.622600959512056e-6,-0.0001641377166379243,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.7881377516459906e-6,0.0,-8.344646857949556e-7,-3.814689989667386e-6,-0.15475383400917053,-0.00011050090688513592,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-6.6756979322235566e-6,0.0,0.0,-6.318072337307967e-6,-3.576278118089249e-7,-1.7881377516459906e-6,-8.940656698541716e-6,-0.052791621536016464,-0.00026913834153674543,-0.09107951819896698,0.0,-0.000058530047681415454,-0.000408327643526718,-0.35133659839630127,-0.0005521441926248372,0.0,-0.0033432324416935444,-0.006092784460633993,-0.000012874520507466514,-0.004684900864958763,-2.7418097943154862e-6,-0.07094913721084595,-0.027656329795718193,-0.004683596082031727,0.0,-0.00954150315374136,-0.5353779196739197,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-4.768360213347478e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000018358061424805783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00004327203714638017,-0.011458891443908215,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,-0.0032726561184972525,-0.004683121107518673,0.0,-0.0007838514284230769],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"b24199ad-a70f-4e22-9d96-288804a1c208"}

Since Jack has 6 books, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of books to find the average number of pages per book:\n\n   960 pages / 6 books = 160 pages per book\n\nThe answer is: 160<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":530,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.00967078935354948,-0.02370656281709671,-0.2942417860031128,-0.5057852268218994,-0.000054238757002167404,0.0,0.0,-0.30444058775901794,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000010609570381348021,-0.010261515155434608,-0.07147090882062912,0.0,-0.12064345926046371,-0.001368777477182448,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00019202772818971425,-0.0004592079494614154,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.38598740100860596,0.0,-0.17462000250816345,-0.10067515820264816,0.0,-3.258669137954712,-0.00004494089080253616,-6.794906312279636e-6,-0.0032725371420383453,0.0,-0.003920133225619793,-0.016707615926861763,-0.0026339145842939615,-0.006790063809603453,-0.8904361724853516,-0.29744625091552734,-0.9497750401496887,-0.019432874396443367,0.0,-0.005421103443950415,-1.5816998481750488,0.0,-0.21452488005161285,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-0.47344857454299927,-0.35712572932243347,-0.0017563169822096825,-0.013778102584183216,-0.0012517482973635197,0.0,0.0,0.0,-2.145764938177308e-6,-0.0022705032024532557,-0.11116483062505722,-0.3435012400150299,-0.2942647933959961,-0.460816890001297,-0.8469351530075073,-0.00004494089080253616,0.0,-0.1090242862701416,-0.29424169659614563,-0.00040415700641460717,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.0004601611872203648,0.0,0.0,-2.250476598739624,-0.875749409198761,-0.9985681176185608,-0.0019339682767167687,-0.032989468425512314,-0.0021074246615171432,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.0026977595407515764,0.0,0.0,-2.145764938177308e-6,-9.536738616588991e-7,0.0,-3.814689989667386e-6,-1.0728830375228426e-6,-0.0006914132391102612,-0.002292506629601121,0.0,-1.5639734268188477,-0.02963666245341301,-5.960462772236497e-7,-2.622600959512056e-6,0.0,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-0.02775546908378601,-0.18290406465530396,-0.0600024089217186,0.0,-0.027842888608574867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.01627856306731701,-0.887814462184906,-0.00013124081306159496,0.0,0.0,-0.0000770062324590981,-0.5302722454071045,-0.0022896521259099245,-0.00005376194530981593,-0.001672775368206203,0.0,0.0,-6.318072337307967e-6,0.0,-0.004135509487241507,-8.106198947643861e-6,-0.056212179362773895,0.0,-0.000012874520507466514,-0.019402826204895973,0.0,0.0,-1.311301275563892e-6,-0.000027894584491150454,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.29525667428970337,0.0,-0.001280560391023755,-0.24137772619724274,-0.00007688703772146255,0.0,-0.023149587213993073,-2.0265558760002023e-6,-0.000012874520507466514,-0.00024148885859176517],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"aec84f12-aed8-41b7-a157-0c5003efaae8"}

Add the total increase to the initial membership fee to find the cost of the membership in the sixth year.\n   Initial fee + Total increase = $80 + $50 = $130\n\nThe answer is: $130<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":727,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.04688834398984909,-0.002110398607328534,-0.21515445411205292,-0.403957724571228,-0.0016020808834582567,-0.05937284231185913,0.0,-0.00038413776201196015,-0.01961781643331051,0.0,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.11085107177495956,-0.04769347235560417,0.0,-0.9814294576644897,-0.1554262638092041,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.00006675497570540756,-0.00007712543447269127,0.0,-0.8748637437820435,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0654882937669754,-0.7325751781463623,-0.001602675998583436,-7.318277835845947,-0.014439143240451813,-0.3327515125274658,-0.000798859924543649,-0.005611381959170103,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.9435721635818481,-3.576272320060525e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.0000523315102327615,-0.0002488780301064253,0.0,-6.556489552167477e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.2647292912006378,-0.00038354191929101944,-2.992460012435913,-0.00017677174764685333,-0.048079151660203934,-0.03367781266570091,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.09623970836400986,-5.960462772236497e-7,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,-2.264974000354414e-6,-0.00505597610026598,-5.960462772236497e-7,-2.50339189733495e-6,-0.07930135726928711,0.0,0.0,-0.07981427758932114,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.07975506037473679,-4.768370445162873e-7,-1.2003276348114014,-0.00007283422019099817,-0.04339117184281349,-0.003690576646476984,-0.02788219042122364,-8.344646857949556e-7,-1.2166383266448975,-0.02762119472026825,-0.000012636104656849056,-0.15473045408725739,0.0,0.0,-0.0007879013428464532,0.0,-3.3378546504536644e-6,0.0,-0.08527844399213791,-0.15647222101688385,-0.3743975758552551,-0.0020549625623971224,-0.0032116996590048075,-7.152555099310121e-7,0.0,-0.013101564720273018,0.0,-0.2733355462551117,-4.027741432189941,-0.10660776495933533,-0.002737823873758316,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.3762500286102295,-0.012925062328577042,-0.11393263936042786,-0.023159487172961235,-1.3668696880340576,-0.000023245540432981215,-0.00022432672267314047,-0.009720847010612488,-0.11077894270420074,-0.06710170954465866,-0.16157951951026917,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.4378256797790527,-0.5762646794319153,-0.000019430925021879375,-0.3378831744194031,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.1905149668455124,-0.00226205843500793,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-2.622600959512056e-6,-1.311301275563892e-6,-5.960462772236497e-7,0.0,-0.026287326589226723,-0.000026225699912174605,0.0,-0.25977393984794617,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.01634025387465954,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.027619339525699615,0.0,-9.536738616588991e-7,-0.0003911683743353933,0.0,-0.03296005353331566,-0.009561575949192047,-7.152555099310121e-7,-0.19495531916618347,-3.2571399211883545,-0.20996282994747162,-0.009537843056023121,-0.00038354191929101944,0.0,-1.9073468138230965e-6,0.0,-0.000548331590835005,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1604022979736328,-0.7901900410652161,-2.129622459411621,-0.25285616517066956,-0.00003135155202471651,-0.00009536288416711614,-1.961804986000061,-7.152555099310121e-7,-0.000548331590835005,0.0,0.0,-0.09484593570232391,0.0,0.0,-0.00013314791431184858,-0.08190364390611649,-0.000013589766240329482,0.0,-0.0013399679446592927,-0.0013443727511912584,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0000641325386823155],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"568b9101-c4ac-4a1d-bada-a55357d9306c"}
