First, we need to convert the numbers to base 10 for easier calculation.\n\n   $218_9$ can be written as:\n   $2 \\times 9^2 + 1 \\times 9^1 + 8 \\times 9^0$\n   $= 2 \\times 81 + 1 \\times 9 + 8 \\times 1$\n   $= 162 + 9 + 8$\n   $= 179_{10}$\n\n   $5_9$ is already in base 10, which is 5.\n\n2. Multiply the numbers in base 10.\n   $179_{10} \\times 5_{10} = 895_{10}$\n\n3. Now, we need to convert the result back to base 9.\n\n   To do this, we'll repeatedly divide the number by 9 and keep track of the remainders.\n\n   $895 \\div 9 = 99 \\ R 4$\n   $99 \\div 9 = 11 \\ R

Then $\\angle A = 2y$. \n\nSo, $2y + y = 180^\\circ$ which simplifies to $3y = 180^\\circ$. \n\nDividing both sides by $3$ gives $y = 60^\\circ$. \n\nThen $\\angle A = 2y = 2(60^\\circ) = 120^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{120}$.<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":572,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.10930260270833969,-0.5304414629936218,-0.8129264712333679,0.0,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.09345053881406784,-0.04677640646696091,-1.6438976526260376,-0.7148761749267578,-0.006716533098369837,-0.13478641211986542,-0.00016473367577418685,-2.3419976234436035,0.0,-0.27914828062057495,-0.10051636397838593,0.0,-0.1342499703168869,-0.00472263153642416,0.0,-0.019396396353840828,-0.000785280775744468,-0.154799684882164,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.00001847726889536716,-0.15965703129768372,-0.000037788631743751466,-0.06867903470993042,0.0,-0.40092501044273376,-0.3592492341995239,-0.6130208969116211,-0.7877976298332214,-0.00023338454775512218,-0.812293529510498,-0.003349886042997241,-0.00014888131408952177,-1.5716066360473633,-0.6406934261322021,-1.3706128597259521,-0.00003302042750874534,-0.00033945043105632067,-0.000039219088648678735,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-9.536738616588991e-7,-0.027806947007775307,-0.42313018441200256,-2.4421439170837402,-0.0009722749819047749,-0.00007903263758635148,0.0,-0.0005486889858730137,0.0,0.0,-0.00010978573118336499,0.0,0.0,-0.7870759963989258,-0.10864205658435822,-0.24793320894241333,-0.048897288739681244,-0.13099227845668793,0.0,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-0.00011550712952157483,-0.002868230454623699,-0.01940949074923992,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,-5.364403477869928e-6,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.4305104514278355e-6,-0.003981758840382099,-0.6366205215454102,-0.00005495397272170521,-0.09303592145442963,-0.03303295001387596,-0.000010132738680113107,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.0005611990345641971,-0.00009643566590966657,-5.483612312673358e-6,-7.152555099310121e-7,-0.00007450303382938728,0.0,-0.4113825857639313,-1.9250271320343018,-1.1060007810592651,-0.006680772174149752,-0.0016020808834582567,-0.00010597144137136638,-2.145764938177308e-6,-0.010775003582239151,-0.000010013530300057027,-3.576278118089249e-7,-1.9073468138230965e-6,-0.0032726561184972525,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.39346691966056824,-0.9037625789642334,-0.12034545093774796,-0.005702062509953976,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0007893307483755052,-9.417489309271332e-6,-0.00005173549288883805,-0.008057115599513054,-0.0015986294019967318,-0.0054589249193668365,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,-1.7881377516459906e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.000037788631743751466,-0.19194519519805908,-0.2700119912624359,-1.5109939575195312,-0.6985928416252136,-3.8572707176208496,-0.0008301864145323634,-0.0011219641892239451,-6.437280717364047e-6,-2.264974000354414e-6,-1.311301275563892e-6,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.000011444026313256472,-0.000395815703086555,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.5802638530731201,-1.053658366203308,-0.3125254809856415,0.0,0.0,-0.00005149708886165172,-0.003911583684384823,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.00003755022044060752,-8.344646857949556e-7,0.0,-0.000013708974620385561,0.0,-0.1800639033317566,-0.31330591440200806,-0.8044249415397644,-0.016246896237134933,-0.2145293951034546,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.019396279007196426,-0.8878128528594971,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.366926670074463,-0.03359009698033333,-0.7868301868438721,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.000010847986231965479,-0.0002683041093405336,-0.00018785618885885924,-0.00005507317473529838,0.0,-0.025664400309324265,-0.09132468700408936,-2.895388603210449,-0.412728875875473,0.0,-0.11068449914455414,-0.000029205850296420977,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.043437857180833817,-0.014189423061907291,-0.000011444026313256472,-0.009544337168335915,-0.2636769711971283,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.0005504761938937008,0.0,-0.00023100091493688524,-0.0009374991059303284,-0.0011206544004380703,-3.576278118089249e-7,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,-0.532225489616394,-0.012080716900527477,-0.18156522512435913,-0.0012407946633175015,-0.3099451959133148,-0.8878316879272461,-1.644702434539795,-0.03943316638469696,-2.1952884197235107,-0.05656856298446655,-0.00007116541382856667],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"e1e2061c-94b5-4db2-beb8-b0733c6e86cc"}
{"text":"<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nIn trapezoid $ABCD$, sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are parallel, $\\angle A = 2\\angle D$, and $\\angle C = 3\\angle B$.  Find $\\angle A$.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIn a trapezoid, the sum of the interior angles is equal to 360 degrees. However, this is not necessary to solve the problem. \n\nGiven that $\\angle A = 2\\angle D$ and $\\angle C = 3\\angle B$, we need to find the value of angle A.\n\nSince $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are parallel, we know that $\\angle A + \\angle D = 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle C + \\angle B = 180^{\\circ}$.\n\nLet's assign a variable to $\\angle D$. We'll call it $x$. Then $\\angle A = 2x$.\n\nSince $\\angle A + \\angle D = 180^{\\circ}$, we can substitute the values:\n\n$2x + x = 180^{\\circ}$\nCombine like terms:\n$3x = 180^{\\circ}$\nSolve for x:\n$x =

Each face of the cube has 9 painted unit squares. Since there are 6 faces, the total number of painted unit squares is 6 * 9 = 54.\n2. However, we need to account for the fact that the four edge faces painted on each face are also painted on the other face. This means that 24 of the painted faces are on cubes with two painted faces.\n3. Since each of the 8 corner cubes has three painted faces, we also need to account for the fact that each of these 8 cubes has 3 painted faces.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of painted unit cubes:\n\n- 8 corner cubes have 3 painted faces, so they contribute 8 * 3 = 24 painted faces.\n- The remaining 6 faces have 6 * 6 = 36 painted faces, but 24 of these are on cubes with two painted faces. So, we only count 36 - 24 = 12 painted faces from these 6 faces.\n- The total number of painted faces is 24 (from the corner cubes) + 12 (from the remaining faces) = 36.\n\nHowever, since each cube has 6 faces, we have counted each painted cube twice. Therefore, the total number of painted cubes is 36 / 2 = 18.\n\nNow, we know that 18 cubes have painted faces. To find out how many of the 125 unit cubes have no paint on them, we subtract 18 from 125:\n\n125 - 18 = 107.\n\nTherefore, the number of unit cubes with no paint on them is 107.\n\n\\boxed{107}<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":1427,"reward":0.0,"logprobs":[-0.01635737530887127,-0.25261643528938293,-2.916057825088501,-0.013626768253743649,0.0,-0.08174788951873779,0.0,-0.0008058876264840364,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-8.344646857949556e-7,0.0,-0.00016950124700088054,0.0,-1.311301275563892e-6,-8.940656698541716e-6,0.0,-3.3378546504536644e-6,-0.04678903520107269,-0.4266299903392792,0.0,-1.270495891571045,-0.8053582906723022,-0.2943606972694397,-0.04676742106676102,-0.00008237022848334163,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.05199137702584267,-0.0421617329120636,-0.15478722751140594,-0.7700341939926147,-1.0211880207061768,-0.00005531158240046352,-0.8084291219711304,-0.3432210683822632,-0.009569250978529453,-0.00007676783570786938,-0.7076624631881714,-0.00456837797537446,-0.01235851552337408,-0.0038628973998129368,-0.2944076955318451,-0.002299404935911298,-8.583032467868179e-6,-0.3144811689853668,-0.2807920575141907,-0.02813500352203846,-5.245195097813848e-6,-0.1550646275281906,-3.4570634852570947e-6,-0.000010847986231965479,-0.3480256497859955,-0.28923720121383667,-0.15532083809375763,-0.003927495330572128,-5.245195097813848e-6,-0.000578474544454366,-0.13347771763801575,-0.0035527939908206463,-0.24670758843421936,-0.6332874894142151,-3.7773778438568115,-0.11510620266199112,-4.768370445162873e-7,0.0,-0.000021576648578047752,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-2.1118557453155518,-0.14833950996398926,0.0,-0.0022506401874125004,0.0,-0.7826393246650696,-0.22702528536319733,0.0,-0.9662817716598511,-7.510157047363464e-6,-0.0002575780963525176,-0.17815141379833221,0.0,-0.3487246334552765,-0.06001116335391998,-0.0002498314715921879,-0.003020013216882944,-0.000012397689715726301,-0.00003886147169396281,-2.50339189733495e-6,-0.000028013790142722428,-6.794906312279636e-6,-7.986990567587782e-6,-0.0023941919207572937,-0.00001537788011773955,-9.894321920000948e-6,-1.0027918815612793,-0.00017105070583056659,-0.0026812339201569557,-0.04630282148718834,-0.0006124289939180017,-0.035845376551151276,-0.022148512303829193,-0.004109628964215517,-0.0027354462072253227,-0.004767716862261295,-0.007363086566329002,-0.000060794889577664435,-0.0019252828788012266,-0.00007545663538621739,-0.0004621868138201535,-3.933898824470816e-6,-0.0000252720492426306,-8.344646857949556e-7,-3.933898824470816e-6,-0.41683125495910645,-0.0004680253332480788,0.0,-2.1022469997406006,-0.4059394598007202,-0.02836284227669239,-3.603300094604492,-0.008242045529186726,-0.9275162220001221,-0.23465456068515778,-0.21473032236099243,-0.04530324786901474,-0.5302894711494446,-0.29562538862228394,-1.0728830375228426e-6,-0.042087215930223465,-0.792958676815033,-3.579318046569824,-0.009592629969120026,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.6901889443397522,-3.576278118089249e-7,-0.18474586308002472,-0.2602089047431946,-2.7418097943154862e-6,-2.483346462249756,-0.06742459535598755,-0.31611335277557373,-1.6852920055389404,-9.059865078597795e-6,-0.21746377646923065,-0.13888104259967804,-0.23387411236763,-0.0013556823832914233,-0.09428881853818893,-0.0009639384225010872,-1.517582654953003,-0.22091595828533173,-0.035216983407735825,-0.2530626654624939,-0.00002825220326485578,-0.1030808761715889,-0.000328367663314566,-0.25528377294540405,-0.000010132738680113107,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.0018941095331683755,-0.1816171258687973,-0.000024199192921514623,-0.4919467866420746,-0.025041084736585617,-1.0603153705596924,-3.080472707748413,-0.06088286638259888,-0.000010847986231965479,-0.3839842677116394,-0.003546854481101036,-0.009643517434597015,-0.03334107995033264,-3.3378546504536644e-6,-2.4358930587768555,-0.24415062367916107,-0.19913333654403687,-0.3729097545146942,-0.03259330987930298,-0.040817148983478546,-0.0014511541230604053,-0.0009373800130560994,-0.021644214168190956,-0.0001308832288486883,-4.768370445162873e-7,-9.536738616588991e-7,-0.01469855010509491,-0.1560082733631134,-0.042520876973867416,-0.00011944057769142091,-3.1014232635498047,-0.09020794183015823,-0.18686841428279877,-0.10851169377565384,-1.1291215419769287,-0.33456459641456604,-0.010494405403733253,-1.0905375480651855,-0.0009059377480298281,-0.2942429482936859,-1.370818018913269,-0.01024417020380497,-2.7418097943154862e-6,-8.4638240878121e-6,-0.004090751986950636,-0.002817234955728054,-0.9346426725387573,-0.061209894716739655,-0.5123125910758972,-0.11080902814865112,-0.0069404239766299725,-0.04844480752944946,-1.9581001996994019,-0.3293762803077698,-0.040145955979824066,-0.0029622504953294992,-0.07868437469005585,-0.003272418398410082,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-1.1367075443267822,-0.5303468704223633,-0.03353326767683029,-1.6752022504806519,-1.7463352680206299,-0.3051036596298218,-0.2807717025279999,-0.3985320031642914,-0.00003814624506048858,-0.000278195773717016,-0.00008034383063204587,-0.0007114263135008514,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.000012636104656849056,-1.080047369003296,-0.0017702399054542184,-0.8384883403778076,-0.11071982234716415,-0.1537318229675293,-0.000026702524337451905,-0.00018904806347563863,-0.0606565959751606,-0.000

Nine unit squares are painted on each of the six faces of the cube. \n   So, the total number of painted unit squares on each face is 9.\n\n2. However, each of the four edge faces painted on each face is also painted on the other face. \n   These 24 painted faces are counted twice, so we have to subtract 24 from the total count of painted faces.\n   Hence, the total number of uniquely painted faces is 6 * 9 - 24 = 30.\n\n3. Since each face has 9 uniquely painted faces and we have 30 uniquely painted faces, \n   it means that each uniquely painted face is on the face of one of the 30 unit cubes.\n\n4. Now, we need to find the number of unpainted unit cubes. \n   We know that there are a total of 125 unit cubes. \n   Out of these, 30 are painted. So, the number of unpainted unit cubes is 125 - 30 = 95.\n\nTherefore, the number of unit cubes with no paint on them is

= 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\nHowever, we can simplify the calculation by using the fact that $\\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!} = n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-r+1)$. \n\n$\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\dfrac{25!}{2!(25-2)!}$\n$= \\dfrac{25 \\times 24}{2 \\times 1}$\n$= \\dfrac{600}{2}$\n$= 300$\n\nSo, $\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\boxed{300}$.<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":612,"reward":1.0,"logprobs":[-0.002046397188678384,-0.0003135904553346336,-0.00005709961988031864,-0.000027417760065873154,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,0.0,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,-6.6756979322235566e-6,-0.0022257810924202204,-2.8018598556518555,-0.021795039996504784,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.019857654348015785,-0.0804704874753952,-0.00900139007717371,-0.043428611010313034,-0.0954444631934166,-6.198863957251888e-6,0.0,0.0,-0.0000641325386823155,0.0,-0.1547313630580902,-0.000045060096454108134,-0.0006561510381288826,-6.437280717364047e-6,-0.15473054349422455,0.0,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-8.344646857949556e-7,-5.960462772236497e-7,-0.00013136000779923052,-0.0007857572636567056,-7.152555099310121e-7,-0.000026225699912174605,0.0,-4.887569048150908e-6,-0.0019102912629023194,-0.3123122453689575,-0.16284185647964478,-0.00001168244216387393,-0.7870723605155945,-4.887569048150908e-6,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-0.0013917532050982118,-0.001320681651122868,-0.5302754640579224,-0.6931473016738892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-3.099436753473128e-6,0.0,-8.344646857949556e-7,-0.4869563579559326,-0.00007795983401592821,-0.07107538729906082,-3.2792670726776123,-0.21372856199741364,-0.00038795097498223186,-0.0006951061659492552,-0.29425013065338135,0.0,-0.18242281675338745,0.0,0.0,-0.000026225699912174605,-0.0032721806783229113,0.0,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,0.0,-0.8122801184654236,-6.6756979322235566e-6,-0.5844171047210693,0.0,-0.21839433908462524,0.0,-0.18221639096736908,-0.027776570990681648,-0.6094930768013,-0.000031709168979432434,-0.6623814702033997,0.0,-1.074811577796936,-0.07295502722263336,-0.000013947389561508317,-2.145764938177308e-6,-0.0009688212885521352,-1.311301275563892e-6,-1.1920922133867862e-6,-0.03711211681365967,-0.06621656566858292,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-5.722029527532868e-6,0.0,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-1.1836005449295044,-0.21768049895763397,0.0,-0.00003766942609217949,0.0,0.0,-1.103507399559021,-1.311301275563892e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.09188411384820938,-0.4377348721027374,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.15565451979637146,-1.6481070518493652,-0.024601636454463005,-0.28236597776412964,-0.008400817401707172,-0.1404210925102234,-1.5235846042633057,-0.0016263603465631604,-0.36579152941703796,-1.4305104514278355e-6,-0.3223903775215149,-1.113515019416809,0.0,-0.004774242173880339,-2.0265558760002023e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.0041276742704212666,0.0,-0.01650126278400421,-1.7881377516459906e-6,-0.02315552718937397,-8.583032467868179e-6,-0.0434352308511734,-0.5312586426734924,-7.867782187531702e-6,0.0,-0.000025987286790041253,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.21694082021713257,-0.0003499372396618128,0.0,-0.16680052876472473,-0.007985570468008518,-0.00001645074735279195,-0.00005376194530981593,-1.2368038892745972,-0.000014662635294371285,-0.3916155993938446,-2.1609015464782715,-1.1134865283966064,0.0,0.0,-0.0019152885070070624,0.0,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.00023064337437972426,-0.00003123234637314454,-0.00004410646579344757,-0.000045060096454108134,0.0,-0.00001645074735279195,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.011651678010821342,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.00018773700867313892,-0.006715940777212381,-0.00015853578224778175,-2.3841855067985307e-7,0.0,-3.4570634852570947e-6,-0.1824057400226593,-1.5032227039337158,-0.26159346103668213,-0.0131207425147295,-0.00078671018127352,-0.00001537788011773955,0.0,-0.001625765347853303,-8.4638240878121e-6,-0.4629598557949066,-0.0001879753835964948,-0.000029205850296420977,-9.536738616588991e-7,-0.21454517543315887,-0.005707396660000086,-0.11213183403015137,-5.722029527532868e-6,-3.2186455882765586e-6,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.3429584205150604,-0.0010477773612365127,-0.00012337400403339416,-0.000022172682292875834,-0.25310903787612915,-0.00007795983401592821,0.0,-0.00013219437096267939,-0.07877164334058762,-5.483612312673358e-6,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.013606659136712551,-0.000013589766240329482,-2.50339189733495e-6,-3.933898824470816e-6,-0.011499196290969849,-1.311301275563892e-6,-0.002533442573621869,-0.6841517090797424,-0.0017178792040795088,-0.5405702590942383,-0.39828285574913025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.016264723613858223,-0.00005578839045483619,-0.023152150213718414,-3.6954811548639555e-6,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-1.1920928244535389e-7,-0.011443688534200191,-0.004675764590501785,-0.0002686616498976946],"ref_logprobs":[],"group_id":"8defa02f-383c-4768-85dd-f5cc7cc38919"}
